# United States SIGINT System January 2007 Strategic Mission List 

## Introduction - Director's Intent

(S//SI) The SIGINT Strategic Mission List represents the intent of the Director, National Security Agency in regard to mission priorities and risks for the United States SIGINT System (USSS) over the next 12-18 months. The list is derived from review of the Intelligence Community National Intelligence Priorities Framework, DCI/DNI Guidance, the Strategic Warning List, National SIGINT Requirements Process (NSRP) and other strategic planning documents. The missions included on the list are in relative priority order and represent the most urgent tasks for the USSS. The list is not intended to be all encompassing, but is intended to set forth guidance on the highest priorities.

## Topical Missions and Enduring Targets

(S//SI) The SIGINT Strategic Mission List is divided into two parts. It includes 16 critical topical missions in Part I of the list, which represent missions discerned to be areas of highest priority for the USSS, where SIGINT can make key contributions. In addition to the 16 critical topical missions, Part II of the SIGINT Strategic Mission List includes 6 enduring targets that are included due to the need to work these targets holistically because of their strategic importance. In addition to their long-term strategic importance, the enduring targets can potentially "trump" the highest priority topical missions on the list at any time, based upon evolving world events. Elements of these targets are also represented throughout the topical target sets. For each of the 16 topical missions and each of the 6 enduring targets the Strategic Mission List includes:

1) Focus Areas - critically important targets against which the SIGINT enterprise is placing emphasis. DIRNSA designation of a target as a focus area constitutes his guidance to the SIGINT System that it is a "must do" target for that mission.
2) Accepted Risks - strategically significant targets against which the USSS is not placing emphasis and for which SIGINT should not be relied upon as a primary source. DIRNSA's reasons for accepting these risks include high difficulty and lack of resources or as an "Economy of Force Measure," in order to achieve focus on the most critical targets.

## A Strategic Investment Tool for SIGINT Resources

(S//SI) Given a finite level of resources available in all mission areas, the Strategic Mission List provides high-level strategic direction to the global SIGINT system to focus resources on the most important/highest priority areas. "Risks" identify targets that cannot be resourced to the level of a Focus Area, thereby acknowledging that shortfalls will exist. As world circumstances change, these or other targets can be added to the list as needed; targets no longer of critical importance can also be removed from the Focus Area category. In addition, other targets, not listed as focus or risk areas, can also be worked by the USSS to a lesser degree to meet other customer requirements. The Strategic Mission List will be reviewed biannually by the USSS Signals Intelligence Leadership Team. Missions, Focus areas, and Accepted Risks will be adjusted as a means of providing high-level steerage to the Nation's agile SIGINT System.
