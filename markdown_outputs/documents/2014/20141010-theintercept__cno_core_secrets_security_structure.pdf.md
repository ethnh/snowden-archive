(TSI/SI/INF) This slide depicts the theoretical construct for a national security framework.
a. The black area depicts a small set of facts that will need special protection at the Exceptionally Controlled Information (ECI) (NSA) and Special Access Program (SAP) for the rest of the Executive Branch. Normally, these ECI/SAP facts will remain within each Department/Agency and will represent Computer Network Operations (CNO) Core Secrets.
b. The red (Top Secret), orange (Secret) and yellow (Confidential) areas depict a set of facts that will be shared amongst National Initiative elements. General facts related to the National Initiative should be kept at these classification levels in order to facilitate maximum information sharing amongst all National Initiative elements (U.S. and foreign governments).
c. The blue (Unclassified/For Official Use Only) area depicts a set of facts and operational results that will be shared/released to U.S. and foreign governments, State and Local governments, industry and academia related to the National Initiative.
d. The green (Unclassified) area depicts a set of facts and operational results that will be shared/released to the public.

(SiINF) This slide depicts the overarching (umbrella) program Sentry Eagle. Which is envisioned to be the program name for the National Initiative. The Sentry Eagle program and its facts will be general TS and below information about the program that could be readily shared with appropriately cleared individuals. The Sentry Eagle program would not contain ECI or SAP information.
The red, gold and blue boxes depict the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Department of Defense (DOD) and Director of National Intelligence (DNI) sub-programs of Sentry Eagle that will contain specific Department Agency facts related only to that Department/Agency. These sub-programs may contain SAP information and will only be shared on a "need to know" basis with other Departments/Agencies.

(TS//SI/NF) This slide depicts the NSA/JFCC-NW portion of the National Initiative - Sentry Eagle. Currently, NSA envisions seven sets of facts: General facts related to NSA's role/operations/participation (depicted in the red/orange/yellow/blue/green box - TS and below information), and six Exceptionally Controlled Information sets (Sentry - Hawk (Computer Network Exploitation); Falcon (Computer Network Defense); Osprey (Human Intelligence enabled SIGINT); Raven (Exploitation of Encipherment); Condor (General Computer Network Operations); and Owl (Relationships with Industry).
