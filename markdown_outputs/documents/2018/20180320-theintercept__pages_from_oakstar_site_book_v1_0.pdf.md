# (U) Introduction 

(U//FOUO) This handbook will familiarize travelers with the tools to prepare them for traveling under the OAKSTAR program. Details of responsibility and the identification of key support organizations are included.

## (U) Background

(TS//SI//NF) Traveling for OAKSTAR primarily involves traveling within the continental United States. The first name of each of the below bullets refers to the SSO project name; the second name is the name the NSA/CSS Commercial Solutions Center (NCSC) identifies the partner relationship by. SSO and NCSC jointly administer the programs with each of the below partners. Currently, the following are supported under this program:
![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)
(TS//SI//NF) These programs involve ventures with US companies. While the travel is mostly U//FOUO with respect to the cities traveled to, the identities of persons and companies met, addresses of facilities, etc. are protected under the SSO WHIPGENIE ECI and the NCSC AAA ECI. Therefore, you must currently hold one of the two ECI's to travel within the program. If you currently do not hold the ECI's and are in need of traveling for the program, you must first speak to the Program Director (PD), Deputy Program Director (DPD) or Mission Program Manager (MPM) in advance of the travel date.
# (U) General Authority 

## (U) Locally or Continental United States

(C) The Special Source Operations (SSO), Program Management Division (PMD) coordinates interaction with the Partner, approves funding for TDYs, handles interaction with NCSC, and helps with the passing of clearances as appropriate. This includes working with SSO Engineering and Technical Services (ETS) and Operations and Discovery Division (ODD) reps, as well as other government agencies to accomplish this task.

## (U) CONUS

(U//FOUO) Every trip should have a designated team lead. The team leader is responsible for the technical aspects of the deployment. This includes providing timely updates to the OAKSTAR PMD team at NBP320. Normally, a PMD member will take this role if on the TDY. The person assigned as the lead for the visit is required to submit a Trip Report within five days of the conclusion of the visit. Contact PMD for the template and/or a sample from a previous visit, if needed.

## (U) Travel

(U//FOUO) Contractors are generally not allowed to travel on these programs or meet with the partners. If an exception must be made, the contractor will need to see the PD or DPD with advance notice, and coordination will be initiated with NCSC.
(C) The PD, DPD or MPM will be in charge of arranging all meetings with the Partners, sometimes in conjunction with the NCSC PD. The arrangements can be delegated to ODD/ETS reps as required.

## (U) Travel Planning and Planning Message

(U//FOUO) LL42 Corporate Travel Services (on the NSA Intranet at "go travel") can assist with all aspects of official travel to include information on government travel charge cards, reservations via $\square$ official government passports. Request for Travel Authorization (RTA) forms, travel checklists and much more. $\square$ will also schedule rental cars and hotels. As with all travel, always check rental car and actual expenses as authorized.
(TS//NF) Here is some helpful travel information.

## (U) TDY Pre-Briefs

(U//FOUO) These discussions will be held via email or team meetings.

## (U) TDY De-Briefs

(U//FOUO) These discussions will be held via email or team meetings.

## (C) Guidelines and Rules for Partner Visits, Interaction, etc.

(TS//SI//NF) TDY and partner interaction with these programs is very sensitive and not like a typical trip to a contractor facility or a DOD installation. The following guidance must be followed. Failure to comply with these measures could result in detrimental damage to the mission of the program.

- (C) Locations vary throughout the Continental US with the exception of MONKEYROCKET and MONTRENCE, which forward data from the ETC, Weisbaden, GE.
- (U//FOUO) NO NSA BADGES OR NSA INSIGNIA APPAREL.
- (S) Do not use DOD identification. Use your Driver's License for identification (where applicable).
- (U//FOUO) When entering facility:
- Sign in at front desk with:

Name: Self
POC: Meeting POC
Represents: Either 'Self', or USG if appropriate (May vary with partnerdo not list NSA.)

## (U) TOTION OF THE SICH

![img-5.jpeg](img-5.jpeg)

- (U//FOUO) Clothing/attire should be appropriate for the occasion and/or to blend into the environment. Non-casual attire could cause an operational security risk/red flag
at certain sites. If in the military, do not wear your uniform. Check with the PD for guidance on proper attire before traveling.

- (S//NF) Remain courteous to all Partners. Remember this is a partnership as much as a contractual relationship. Partners may not necessarily be accustomed to doing work with the government. Generally, these business associates are extremely patriotic, and deserve to be treated with the utmost respect and courtesy. While we typically have a contractual relationship with the company we work with, these efforts are more a partnership then a classic DOD contract.
- (S//NF) Always be aware of your audience. Remain cognizant of the clearance level of the person(s) you are speaking with or meeting with. Remember NEVER DISCUSS OR SHARE ANOTHER PARTNERS INFORMATION!
- (S//NF) Witting vs. Non Witting. No assumptions should be made that all people at the company are cleared to the NSA relationship. You should only be working with the people that are cleared. This is a case-by-case occurrence.


# (U) Process for TDY 

1. (U//FOUO) Send an email or discuss the details on the proposed trip with the PMD rep. These trips can also be discussed over the phone or at team meetings. Include the following information:
a. Destination
b. Traveling Cell Phone Number (if available)
c. Dates
d. Purpose
e. Identification of all parties traveling in the group for clearances
i. Name
ii. Place of Birth
iii. Date of Birth
iv. Social Security Number
v. Contractor - company name
vi. GS rating or equivalent
2. (U//FOUO) Clearances for all OAKSTAR team members are sent in December each year for the entire next calendar year but new team members or non-team members traveling on behalf of OAKSTAR should check with PMD first and be prepared to provide the information above in 1.e. i-vi.
3. (U//FOUO) A PMD rep will confirm approval or disapproval. Once approved, since PMD finances the trip you should prepare an RTA for PMD signature approval (PD \& D/PD) with a 'CC' to your division leadership for information only. PMD will sign and forward the RTA to the OAKSTAR budget representative for
inclusion of a fund cite and forwarding to the NSA travel office for processing. The budget rep will provide you with a 'CC' for your records.
4. (U//FOUO) Before your trip, verify with PMD that all clearances were properly passed.
5. (U//FOUO) Make sure prior to departure you have contact information, directions, phone numbers and the POC. $\square$ may send you a link in your travel packet for tax exempt forms for hotel lodging. Do the taxpayer a favor by bringing that with you to save some funding. Ensure you have your travel packet from $\square$
6. (U//FOUO) Upon your return, forward your completed RTA to PMD for signature within the five day deadline. A copy of all hotel, airline, rental car receipts and any receipt over $\$ 75$ must be included as an attachment for PMD to approve and forward to the TDY office.

# (U) Support 

(U//FOUO) If at any time you are unsure or have questions, contact the PD/DPD/MPM. This handbook serves only as a guide and events may change.
