These design changes make the systems in question exploitable through SIGINT collection (e.g., Endpoint, MidPoint, etc.) with foreknowledge of the modification. To the consumer and other adversaries, however, the systems' security remains intact. In this way, the SIGINT Enabling approach uses commercial technology and insight to manage the increasing cost and technical challenges of discovering and successfully exploiting systems of interest within the ever-more integrated and security-focused global communications environment.\n(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) This Project supports the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI) by investing in corporate partnerships and providing new access to intelligence sources, reducing collection and exploitation costs of existing sources', and enabling expanded network operation and intelligence exploitation to support network defense and cyber situational awareness. This Project contains the SIGINT Enabling Sub-Project.\n(U) Base resources in this project are used to:\n\n- (TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Insert vulnerabilities into commercial encryption systems, IT systems, networks, and endpoint communications devices used by targets.\n- (TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Collect target network data and metadata via cooperative network carriers and/or increased control over core networks.\n- (TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Leverage commercial capabilities to remotely deliver or receive information to and from target endpoints.\n- (TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Exploit foreign trusted computing platforms and technologies.\n- (TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Influence policies, standards and specification for commercial public key technologies.\n- (TS//SI//RI/REL TO USA, FVEY) Make specific and aggressive investments to facilitate the development of a robust exploitation capability against Next-Generation Wireless (NGW) communications.\n- (U//FOUO) Maintain understanding of commercial business and technology trends.\n- (U//FOUO) Procure products for internal evaluation.\n- (U//FOUO) Partner with industry and/or government agencies in developing technologies of strategic interest to NSA/CSS.","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2200,"width":1700}},{"index":1,"markdown":"- (TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Support the SIGINT exploitation of NGW, a MIP/NIP collective investment.
