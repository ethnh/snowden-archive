They retain this information, in part, so they can send their subscribers a bill every month.\n(TS/JSI/NF) The business records include, for example, originating and terminating telephone numbers, International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI), International Mobile Station Equipment Identity (IMEI), trunk identifiers, and telephone calling card numbers.","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":1700,"width":2200}},{"index":3,"markdown":"| DATE/PREPARER: TAP | Topic <br> (TS//SI//NF) BR Bulk Metadata <br> Program (cont.) | Page Classification TOP- <br> -SEGRETI/GOMINTI/NOFORN- |  | Screen Number <br> 4 of 11 |  |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n|  | Home | Exit | Glossary | Back | Next |\n| NEXT FRAME ID: 2050 |  |  |  |  |  |\n| BACK FRAME ID: 2030 |  |  |  |  |  |\n| ALT TAG: |  |  |  |  |  |\n| GRAPHIC/AV: <br> (U) Possible cutaway images may include: <br> - images pertinent to querying metadata producing contact chaining diagrams and other query formats |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n\\{TS//SI//NF\\} (OGC Attorney): As you can imagine, NSA is interested in the same kinds of telephony information for the U.S. and contact chaining analysis.
