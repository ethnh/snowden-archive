Also correlated any selectors moving in relation to the ships' movements using cell fan data.","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":1700,"width":2800}},{"index":1,"markdown":"Mission Example and Result: The HAPPYFOOT analytic aggregates leaked location-based service / location-aware application data to infer IP address geo-locations. SDS identified 'Public' and 'private' usage of the same IP address that caused HAPPYFOOT to assign netblocks to geo-locations (the IP address was used in both countries). This private network is now being realmed and properly geo-located. Ongoing work will solve this realming problem for networks affecting other cloud analytics.","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":1700,"width":2800}},{"index":2,"markdown":"# Our Approach \n\n-Tracked target's converged communications and CNE accesses.\n\n- Monitored passive internet traffic; created automated processes where possible (XKS ANCHORMAN, Workflows, Fingerprints).\n- Provided TAO/GCHQ with WLLids/DSL accounts, Cookies, GooqiePREFIDs to enable remote exploitation.\n- Partnered with NGA and R4 to confirm locations and USRP equipment based on collected photographs.\n- Drove CNE collection and partnered with TAO to increase USRP specific endpoint accesses.\n- Provided knowledge to interagency partners for potential on the ground survey options and FBI-led intelligence guiding efforts.","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":1700,"width":2800}},{"index":3,"markdown":"(S//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Metadata/Target Discovery: Analyze DNR/DNI/Convergence metadata for target discovery, identify gaps in collection, processing, and analytic methodologies; Improve metadata collection and processing; Create analytics that automate or improve analytic methodologies; Conduct target discovery through multiple technology thrusts, including endpoint, web-based technologies/services, mobile applications and networks, geo-location analysis, correlations/identity Analysis, Social Network Analysis; Collaboration/facilitation with TAO, S3, CIA, ODNI, SSO, CES, and SSG centers.","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":1700,"width":2800}}],"model":"mistral-ocr-2503-completion","usage_info":{"pages_processed":4,"doc_size_bytes":261412}}
