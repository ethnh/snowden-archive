Discussions will center on topics of mutual interest and future areas of collaboration. It also presents an opportunity for NSA/CSS leadership to reiterate their commitment to the Swedish partnership.\n\n\n## VISITOR REQUESTED:\n\n- (TS//REL USA, SWE) FRA requested a WINTERLIGHT (Quantum project) update and asked to hear about our plans for sharing reports on Quantum tipping or intercepts from the Quantum tipping. FRA plans to start the conference by giving an overview of its SIGINT Roadmap, to include Russia,\n\nIt will also provide a Cyber update--specifically briefing NSA on its new cyber division, its active and passive sensors and tradecraft collaboration with NSA/CSS Threat Operations Center (NTOC); updates on the special","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2600,"width":1700}},{"index":1,"markdown":"project and NAPA-3; and a discussion of how new legislation has helped improve the FRA-Swedish Security Service (SAPO) relationship.","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2600,"width":1700}},{"index":2,"markdown":"# CDR/DCDR/DDIR GUIDANCE: (U) N/A \n\n## PREP SESSION GUIDANCE:\n\n- (U) Due to the nature of the visit, no specific guidance has been conveyed to other participants.\n\n\n## NSA/CSS REQUESTED:\n\n- (U//FOUO) Further Cyber Security/Defense Cooperation;\n- (S//REL TO USA, SWE) Future CT cooperation (value of CT Deployed Analyst);\n- (S//REL TO USA, SWE) Status of relationship between FRA and SÄPO under the new legislation;\n- (TS//REL TO USA, SWE) Computer Network Exploitation (CNE) Update;\n- (TS//REL TO USA, SWE) Update on special project;\n\n\n## CYBERCOM REQUESTED: (U) N/A\n\n## COMMON THREADS:\n\n- (S//REL TO USA, SWE) Emphasize the value of the NSA-FRA partnership.\n\n\n## KEY TAKEAWAYS:\n\n(S//REL USA, SWE) Recommend General Alexander and D/DIR emphasize the following points:\n\n## Quantum Operations:\n\n- (TS//SI//REL TO USA, SWE) Acknowledge the success that NSA, FRA, and GCHQ have had on WINTERLIGHT. Last month, we received a message from our Swedish partner that GCHQ received FRA QUANTUM tips that led to 100 shots, five of which were successfully redirected to the GCHQ server. The Foreign Affairs Directorate (FAD) confirmed with Tailored Access Operations (TAO) that this validates the \"proof of concept\" that was originally trying to be accomplished. Additionally, FAD, TAO, and Enterprise Information Technology Services are still working through the technical solution to have FRA tip directly to NSA. S3 Data Acquisitions' goal is to have a solution for a direct tip to FRA operational by this summer. The Quantum effort motivated the recent XKEYSCORE installation. FRA is currently evaluating it for use to support their SIGINT Development work.\n\n\n## Cable Access/Reporting and Analysis:\n\n- (TS//SI//REL TO USA, SWE) Highlight that NSA/CSS would like to continue to collaborate on FRA's cable access program, which has resulted in unique SIGINT reporting on a variety of high-priority SIGINT topics ( 123 reports thus far this fiscal year). FRA continues to gain access to more data from additional telecommunications companies, making the cable access potentially lucrative for NSA/CSS for targets beyond Russia.","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2600,"width":1700}},{"index":3,"markdown":"# Cyber: \n\n- (TS//REL TO USA, SWE) Stress that NTOC is ready to seriously engage with FRA on cyber defense. Mr. Åkesson has reviewed the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) and has no changes; therefore, we would like to have an official signing during the 24 April 1130-1200 discussions.\n- (TS//SI//NF) NTOC shared some information with FRA about a Swedish intrusion in November 2012. FRA came in with questions in February 2013 that led NTOC to do more analysis. Subsequently, NTOC reached the same conclusion as FRA, that it involved the Israeli Embassy in Stockholm. FRA asked if it could alert Israel and NTOC agreed that it could tell Israel about the intrusion. Israel's identity was never compromised.\n\n\n## Secure VTC Capability\n\n- (S//REL TO USA, FVEY) Encourage FRA to set up its equipment soonest to allow for secure VTC capability. That capability already exists with Norway and Denmark and has shown benefit in expanding analytic collaboration on a myriad of issues. FRA's technology directorate is just waiting on requirements from its SIGINT directorate to be able to finalize the set-up and installation.\n\n\n## Counterterrorism:\n\n- (TS//SI//REL TO USA, SWE) NSA/CSS' Counterterrorism (CT) analysts and FRA continue to cooperate and collaborate on CT threat-related activities in Europe. Several analyst-to-analyst meetings have taken place and European Cryptologic Center (ECC) in Darmstadt, Germany, is formally coordinating a Staff Processing Form (SPF) to have Sweden assist NSA/CSS with high-priority CT Swedish language traffic that ECC is currently unable to fully analyze. In January 2013, CT established its first CT deployed analyst position in Stockholm. Also in January, FRA and SÄPO were legally allowed to collaborate after a 4 -year hiatus.\n- (S//SI//REL TO USA, SWE) Encourage increased collaboration on CT threat streams.\n\n\n## Russia:\n\n- (S//SI//REL TO USA, SWE) Thank Sweden for its continued work on the Russian target, and underscore the primary role that FRA plays as a leading partner to work the Russian target, including Russian leadership, energy, and counterintelligence. FRA's cable access has resulted in unique SIGINT reporting on all of these areas.\n- (S//SI//REL TO USA, SWE) Encourage continued collaboration and sharing of reporting on Russian topics.","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2600,"width":1700}},{"index":4,"markdown":"# VISIT FORMAT: \n\n- (S//REL TO USA, SWE) GEN Alexander's opening remarks will set the tone for a productive conference.\n- (S//REL TO USA, SWE) FRA will provide briefings on FRA's SIGINT Roadmap; its new cyber division; its relationship with the Swedish Internal Security Service, SÄPO; and updates on the special project and NAPA-3.\n- (U//FOUO) NSA Participants: SID DIR, DIRFA, Associate D/DIR for CT, GCM, Russia Production Center, GCM, Office of South Asia, GCM, Office of China/Korea, NTOC, NCSC, SSO, Special Projects Office (LEGEND).\n\n\n## PREVIOUS VISITS AND RESPECTIVE TOPICS:\n\n- (S//REL TO USA, SWE) Mr. Åkesson last visited NSA/CSS for SWEDUSA in May 2012.\n\nPOTENTIAL LANDMINES: (U) None.\nOTHER INFORMATION: (U) None.\nRECENT PRESS INDICATIONS: (U) None.","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2600,"width":1700}}],"model":"mistral-ocr-2503-completion","usage_info":{"pages_processed":5,"doc_size_bytes":926927}}
