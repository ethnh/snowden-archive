At that time it was agreed that GCHQ would take the lead for the exchange of COMINT information and that NSA would take the lead for the ELINT exchange. As of April 2004, NSA, GCHQ and the FRA agreed to dissolve this part of the UKUSA agreement and hold bilateral exchanges on both COMINT and ELINT.\n(TS//SI/INF) NSA's relationship with the FRA, an extremely competent, technically innovative, and trusted Third Party partner, continues to grow. The FRA provided NSA with access to its cable collection in 2011, providing unique collection on high-priority Russian targets such as leadership, internal politics, and energy.\n\nFRA's efforts against counter-terrorism (CT) targets continue to expand, and new legislation enacted in January 2013 has improved its ability to work directly with the Swedish internal security service (SÃ„PO). NSA's Data Acquisition is actively engaged with the FRA, which has numerous collection sites and is proficient in collecting a wide variety of communications.\n(U) Key Issues\n(TS//SI/INF) The FRA continues to place more emphasis on cyber. NSA's National Threat Operations Center (NTOC) and FRA analysts have an ongoing exchange discussing malware topics. The FRA is positioning itself to become the cyber defense authority in Sweden and hopes to receive the Swedish government mandate in the near future.","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2600,"width":1700}}],"model":"mistral-ocr-2503-completion","usage_info":{"pages_processed":1,"doc_size_bytes":194266}}
