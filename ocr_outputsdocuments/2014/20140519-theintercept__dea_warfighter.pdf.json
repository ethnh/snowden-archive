But how many of us list illegal narcotics among the top threats to our society? Our national leadership recognized the seriousness this problem poses and declared a war on drugs two decades ago. This \"war\" has all the risks, excitement, and dangers of conventional warfare, and the stakes are equally high.\n(U//FOUO) We are all aware that the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is leading our nation's counternarcotics (CN) efforts. But many are not aware that from the start NSA has been at the forefront of Intelligence Community (IC) support to this seemingly unconventional DOD mission. The novel collection and analysis techniques NSA developed and refined against these criminal hard targets have not only resulted in major successes in the war on drugs, but they have also proven invaluable to other critical SIGINT missions, particularly counterterrorism, sometimes blurring the lines between the two missions.\n(C) DEA has close relationships with foreign government counterparts and vetted foreign partners. The results of this team approach regularly make the headlines in the form of major drug busts and arrests. Less known is the critical supporting role that NSA continues to play in key DEA operations to disrupt the flow of narcotics to our country and thwart other, related crimes. DEA, however, recognizes the unique access and sole source information NSA provides and coordinates major cases with the S2F/ICN Product Line.\n(C) As a result, both agencies enjoy a vibrant two-way information sharing relationship that enhances their common mission. Processes have been carefully established to exchange lead (foreign intelligence) information while protecting NSA equities. The Customer Relationships Directorate (S1), the Data Acquisition Directorate (S3), and MRSOC work with the S2F/ICN office as an integrated team to realize these mission successes.\n(S//SI) One of those successes: Based on SCS (US-966L) intercept, S2F/ICN issued an OPS IMMEDIATE report on 30 March 2004 on the exact whereabouts of Colombian narcotics trafficker Gonzalo Hinojosa, an evasive and brutal international fugitive wanted for murder, drug trafficking, and money laundering. S2F had the foresight to include a tearline to share the actionable intelligence with Panamanian partners. With a short window for action, NSA's S2F/ICN is worked through the Joint Interagency Task Force (JITF) - South to immediately forward the information to DEA/Panama. DEA/Panama in turn alerted the Panamanian authorities who quickly located and apprehended Hinojosa, without knowing the information came from NSA SIGINT. As Chief $\\square$ nored, this is an excellent example of \"outcome- oriented collaboration.\"\n(U//FOUO) To learn more about NSA support to the \"other\" warfighter, DEA, visit the International Crime and Narcotics (S2F) website.","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":158,"height":3792,"width":2844}},{"index":1,"markdown":"\"(U//FOUO) SID today articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet without the consent of $\\mathbf{5 0 1 2 1}$ (DL sid_comms).\"\n\nInformation Owner: S0121, S0122 (email)\nPage Publisher: S0121, (email)\nLast Modified: 11/09/2012 / Last\nReviewed: 11/09/2012\nDYNA MIC PAGE - HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":158,"height":3792,"width":2844}}],"model":"mistral-ocr-2503-completion","usage_info":{"pages_processed":2,"doc_size_bytes":146210}}
