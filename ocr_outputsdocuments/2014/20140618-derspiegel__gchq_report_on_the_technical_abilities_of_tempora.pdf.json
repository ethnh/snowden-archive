At the moment there are instances of TEMPORA at all xPC (Namely CPC, OPC and RPC1). These should be referred to, when required, as OPC/CPC/RPC1 TEMPORA\n\n\n# [edit] A bit more detail \n\nTEMPORA are GCHQ's large-scale, Deep Dive deployments on Special Source access (SSE). Deep Dive XKeyscores work by promoting loose categories of traffic (e.g., all web, email, social, chat, EA, VPN, VoIR...) from the bearers feeding the system and block all the high-volume, low value traffic (e.g., P2P downloads). This usually equates to $\\sim 30 \\%$ of the traffic on the bearer. We keep the full sessions for 3 working days and the metadata for 30 days for you to query, using all the functionality that Keyscore offers to slice and dice the data. The aim is to put the best $7.5 \\%$ of our access into TEMPORA's, comprising a mix of Deep Dive Keyscores and promotion of data based on IP subset or technology type from across the entire MVR. At the moment, users are able to access 46 x 10 Gs of data via existing Internet Buffers.. This is a lot of data! Not only that, but the long-running TINT program and our initial 3-month operational trial of the CPC Internet Buffer (the first operational Internet Buffer to be deployed) show that every area of ops can get real benefit from this capability, especially for target discovery and target development. Internet Buffers are different from TINT in that the latter is purely an experimental, research environment whereas Internet Buffers can be used operationally for EPR, Effects, enabling CNE etc.\n\nFor a more detailed depiction of how TEMPORA and TINT differs please see here.\n\n## Iedit1 Contacts\n\n## Name\n\nGTE XKS Senior User\nMTI SIGINT apps theme lead\nEnhanced Discovery Project Manager\nEnhanced Discovery XKS SME","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2600,"width":1700}},{"index":2,"markdown":"3 of 3","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2600,"width":1700}}],"model":"mistral-ocr-2503-completion","usage_info":{"pages_processed":3,"doc_size_bytes":300455}}
