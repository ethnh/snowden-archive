Note that we had wanted to simply include these Opening Remarks Talking Points in our Exec Sum for the visit, but DIR Staff told us they needed a separate document for the Opening Remarks and it needed to be in a specific format. That format is below (example provided is from DENUSA last year).\n\nThe Remarks should outline things that have been accomplished since the last conference, as well as things we want to get accomplished in this conference/the upcoming year. We should also add anything else FAD wants DIRNSA to convey.\n\nOnce the Opening Remarks Talking Points are approved by appropriate DP1 leadership (at least DP1 Office Chief level), the CDO should provide the Opening Remarks in the attached format to the following aliases at least 3 business days in advance of the event:\n\nTO: DL DIRSPEAK\n\nCC: D DIR Staff, DP1 Office Chief/Deputy\nPer guidance from DIR Staff, it is the responsibility of the folks on the DIRCOMMS alias to print out the remarks on 5X8 cards and provide to the DIR staff.\n(Updated on 3/4/2013)","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":1700,"width":1100}},{"index":1,"markdown":"# DENUSA \n\n6-8 June\n(S//REL TO USA, DNK) Thank the Danes for their wonderful hospitality they extended to you and your delegation during your March visit to Copenhagen.\n(TS//SI//REL TO USA, DNK)\n(TS//SI//REL TO USA, DNK) I will be with\n(TS//SI//REL TO USA, DNK) I will be with\n(TS//SI//REL TO USA, DNK) Emphasize NSA's commitment to the special access and assisting DDIS in managing the access.\n\nRemind the Danes of the long NSA-DDIS partnership working cable access with.\n\nNote that we look forward to new areas of cooperation.\n(TS//REL TO USA, DNK) Highlight that NSA is willing to engage with DDIS on cyber defense.","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":1700,"width":1100}},{"index":2,"markdown":"TOP SECRET//SI//REL TO USA, DNK\nWe believe that furthering our cooperation will be mutually beneficial to our two nations.\n(TS//SI//REL TO USA, DNK)\n(TS/REL TO USA, DNK)\n\n# (S//REL TO USA, DNK) Stress that Denmark is a very trusted, capable party. \n\nWe value that partnership and we are pleased to be moving forward with DDIS on critical target areas.\n\nWe believe that furthering our cooperation will be mutually beneficial to our two nations.","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":1700,"width":1100}}],"model":"mistral-ocr-2503-completion","usage_info":{"pages_processed":3,"doc_size_bytes":47653}}
