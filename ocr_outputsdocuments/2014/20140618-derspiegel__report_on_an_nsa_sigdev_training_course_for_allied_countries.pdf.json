This effort enhanced the opportunities for SSEUR partners to work together more effectively to tackle mission areas of mutual interest -especially Afghanistan and Counterterrorism (CT) target sets.\n(U//FOUO) The training was extremely successful, based on survey responses, and many of the partners plan to incorporate information from this course into training programs for their own new SIGINT analysts.\n(U//FOUO) SID, ADET, and FAD are currently creating another more in-depth telephony analysis training course with the hopes of presenting this training to NSA Third Party partners in spring/summer 2011.\n(U//FOUO) For more information on SSG Governance \\& Community Engagement, visit SSG Governance \\& Community Engagement Website (go ssg-gce).\n(U//FOUO) For more information on the Associate Directorate for Education and Training, visit ADET Website (\"go adet\").\n(U//FOUO) For more information on the Foreign Affairs Directorate, visit FAD Website (\"go faks\").\n(U//FOUO) POC\n(U) Notes:\n\n* (S//SI//REL) SSEUR members are the Five Eyes nations (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom and United States) and the following Third Party partners: Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden.
