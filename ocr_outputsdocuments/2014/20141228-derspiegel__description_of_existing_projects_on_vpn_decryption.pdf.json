{"pages":[{"index":0,"markdown":"# SPIN 15 VPN Story \n\nVPN has two thrusts, one has high mission impacts and the other has high performance and functionality impacts for Program B.\n\nMission impact - Start generating SIGINT from VPNs at SMK.\nSMK is a VPN rich environment with targets of high value. Mission impact is high. Consumers of the SIGINT reporting based on sources from SMK are at high levels of government. NSA leadership has tasked CES to deploy decryption capabilities to SMK. Security concerns have been addressed. SPFs have been signed to deploy TS//SI equities to the S//SI site. VPN transformation tests have passed and capabilities ready for deployment to the T-16 development server at SMK. To achieve a successful deployment to SMK on the T-16s (first) and LPTs, the following are high level steps:\n\n| Task | Owner | Date |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| Load Spin 13 on T-16 DEV (first) <br> and then T-16 LIVE system | Turmoil | March |\n| Configure Blade 14 for PIQ <br> Services Spin 13. | CES | March |\n| Configure AMF/IslandHideaway <br> for PIQ blade and VAO messaging <br> traffic | AMF | March |\n| Add IP tasking to Keycard for <br> VPNs of interest | CES | March |\n| Evaluate decrypted data in <br> Xkeyscore for Strong Selectors | CES | March/April |\n| Update Keycard with Strong <br> Selectors | CES | March/April |\n| Verify decrypted data which hits <br> on a strong selector is forwarded <br> from Turmoil to Pressurewave | CES | April |\n| Verify analysts can retrieve the <br> data from Pressurewave for <br> reporting | CES | April |\n| Identify Dell for PIQ Blade at <br> SMK for LPT DEV system | CES | April |\n| Load Spin (13/14 ?) on LPT DEV <br> (first) and then the LPT LIVE <br> Systems | Turmoil | May |\n| Configure Dell for PIQ Services <br> Spin 13. | CES | May |","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2200,"width":1700}},{"index":1,"markdown":"TOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL//20320108 DRAFT\n\n|  |  |  |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| Configure AMF/IslandHideaway <br> for PIQ blade and VAO messaging <br> traffic | AMF | May |\n| Add IP tasking to Keycard for <br> VPNs of interest | CES | May |\n| Evaluate decrypted data in <br> Xkeyscore for Strong Selectors | CES | May/June |\n| Update Keycard with Strong <br> Selectors | CES | May/June |\n| Verify decrypted data which hits <br> on a strong selector is forwarded <br> from Turmoil to Pressurewave | CES | June |\n| Verify analysts can retrieve the <br> data from Pressurewave for <br> reporting | CES | June |\n\nNote: MDC upgrade and Site Store deployment at SMK will impact the VPN decryption deployment. March 16-31 is the schedule for the upgrade and site store deployment. VPN decryption deployment may slip due to availability.\n\nRisk Reduction Activity for Program B\nProgram B Capabilities Document has provided Key Performance Parameterers (KPPs) for VPN. In order to achieve the KPP identified for Sep 30, 2009, a risk reduction activity has been initiated. This activity will gather performance benchmarks early in SPIN 15 on the current architecture running on two 2.5 G platforms, the T-16 Heavy and the Dell LPT. Information from the performance benchmarks will indicate the level of redesign (if any) needed to meet the KPPs. The following are the performance requirements in Program B.\n\n1. NCC CA Service Requests (Decrypt) per hour (aggregate for all VPN exploitation-enabled systems).\n\nQ4 FY09 (Risk 1,000\nReduction)\nQ4 FY10 10,000\nQ4 FY11 100,000\n2. NCC front end systems shall fully process (i.e. decrypt and re-inject) at least $20 \\%$ of CA service requests ( 20\\% Reinject Rate?)\n3. For tasked IP addresses, NCC front end systems shall identify relevant IPSec sessions and generate attack requests (Rates?)\n4. NCC front end systems shall buffer VPN data for up to 15 minutes ( 900 seconds) while waiting for response from Attack Orchestrater (AO)\n5. After successful key recovery and decryption PIQ services shall re-inject decrypted VPN for Stage1 \\& Stage2 processing\n6. Aggregate VPN buffering and processing rate per TML system (Assumptions - LPT? T16? U64?)\n\nQ4 FY09 (Risk 4 VPN 25 Concurrent VPN 100 Mbps Aggregate VPN Data / System","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2200,"width":1700}},{"index":2,"markdown":"| Reduction) | Systems | Flows / System |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Q4 FY10 | 10 VPN <br> Systems | 100 Concurrent VPN 100 Mbps Aggregate VPN Data / System Flows / System |\n| Q4 FY11 | 100 VPN <br> Systems | 100 Concurrent VPN 500 Mbps Aggregate VPN Data / System Flows / System |\n\n7.
