These resources are used to provide crossprogram management services to drive efficiencies within the Special Source Access Expenditure Center (EC). Responsibilities include general management, training, and travel. This Project supports the RAMPART-I program in and the RAMPART-X program in It also supports the MYSTIC Program Office, which leverages partner-enabled accesses against Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) and other cellular and Public Switched Telephone Networks (PSTNs). It supports target technology development through comprehensive and definitive description of foreign targets' current and future use of telecommunications and computer systems. Additionally, this Project sustains efforts to add, enhance, and support Next-Generation Wireless (NGW) capabilities across Special Source Accesses, and efforts to address critical target capability gaps. This Project contains the Special Source Staff Operations Sub-Project.\n(U) Base resources in this project are used to:\n\n- (U//FOUO) Provide travel, training, equipment and general supplies for the Special Source Access front office.\n- (TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Provides initial and emerging access to high-priority SIGINT targets against new requirements, provide management and technical engineering services to analyze and maintain data flow, provide program metrics, and manage allocation of tasks and schedules for SSO collection sources.\n- (S//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Provide contracted services for NGW core network exploitation capabilities to deploy core network exploitation capabilities to collection sites in Caribbean, Kenya, the Philippines, and Mexico.\n- (C//REL TO USA, FVEY) Purchase classified SIGINT processing equipment, associated upgrades, and life-cycle support.\n- (TS//SI//NF) Sustain MYSTIC capabilities to provide comprehensive metadata access and content against targeted communications in Kenya, Caribbean, Mexico, and the Philippines. Provide new PSTN collection capability in on their international links to and Capabilities will offer near-real time, complete access to the additional target country's GSM network(s), and provide for retrospective tasking and near-real-time access/delivery of metadata as required. Activities previously provided by Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) resources are now requested in the base submission.","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":1700,"width":2200}}],"model":"mistral-ocr-2503-completion","usage_info":{"pages_processed":1,"doc_size_bytes":54496}}
