This team began over two years ago with a basic concept compelled by the IC's increasing need for communications metadata and NSA's ability to collect, process and store vast amounts of communications metadata related to worldwide intelligence targets. The ICREACH team delivered the first-ever wholesale sharing of communications metadata within the U.S. Intelligence Community. The SID team did considerable work with NSA/OGC (Office of the General Counsel) and SID/Policy to ensure appropriate legal and policy approvals for this new technical capability. In addition, the team briefed the Second Party partners on this effort to set the stage for Second Party participation in ICREACH. Their efforts hastened implementation of this much-needed capability.\n\nTOP SECRET// COMINT// NOFORN//20320108","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":1700,"width":2200}}],"model":"mistral-ocr-2503-completion","usage_info":{"pages_processed":1,"doc_size_bytes":34536}}
