Currently, NSA collects, processes and stores vast amounts of communications metadata related to worldwide intelligence targets. This SIGINT information often includes the originator and recipient(s) identifiers, as well as the date, time and duration of the transaction and, in some cases, locations of targets.\n(S//NF) CIA, FBI, DIA and DEA also have access to communications transaction data from their unique sources. These organizations, to include NSA, have benefited from sharing this data through the CRISSCROSS/PROTON program since 1999. Presently, NSA pushes roughly 60 million records per day (limited to telephony only) to PROTON, resulting in over $30 \\%$ of the total PROTON data set.\n(S//NF) While the PROTON program has had many notable successes over the years, today's environment requires that the IC implement more holistic information sharing and collaboration. In order to ensure the efficient and effective sharing of many millions of new minimized communications metadata records daily, the IC must have a new sharing/collaboration structure that is scaleable to the larger IC and is capable of much greater volume of data.\n(S//NF) NSA stands alone in conducting metadata analysis on a large scale and as a result, our tools and methodologies, as well as the infrastructure employed, are well tested and have been proven efficient and effective over time. We already extensively\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ *(C) Communications metadata refers to structured \"data about data\": it includes all information associated with, but not including content, and includes any data used by a network, service or application to facilitate routing or handling of a communication or to render content in the intended format; it includes, but is not limited to, dialing, routing, addressing, or signaling information and data in support of various network management activities (e.g. billing, authentication or tracking of communicants).","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":158,"height":3792,"width":2844}},{"index":1,"markdown":"# SECRET//NOFORN/MR \n\nshare metadata internally within the NSA/CSS extended enterprise and with our second party partners.\n(S//NF) Under this proposal, IC partners would have access through NSA's GLOBALREACH (the IC version will be called ICREACH) service to more than 50 existing NSA/CSS metadata fields contained in trillions of records as well as other IC Agency communications metadata (predominantly resident today in PROTON). NSA's throughput to ICREACH would dwarf the volume of NSA's present contributions to PROTON, as well as the input of all other IC contributors. Those fields revealing sources and methods or sensitive foreign relationships within metadata records would not be shared. Moreover, NSA is preparing to include DNI (digital network intelligence) data in GLOBALREACH/ICREACH, a change that would also exponentially increase NSA's contributions to the IC's communications metadata structure.\n\nDISCUSSION: (S//NF) NSA proposes that the DNI establish a new IC-wide communications metadata structure with requisite tools, training and intelligence oversight. This structure will consist of data repositories at various IC Agencies all interlinked through a web based analytic query structure via JWICS whereby IC personnel can make one query to access all sharable communications metadata. This structure will also allow IC personnel to choose the data they wish to query and the set of tools they desire to display and analyze the data.\n(S//NF) This structure will allow unprecedented volumes of communications metadata to be shared and analyzed. This structure will use the Intelligence Community Shared Information Space (ICSIS) carved out in Intelink and protected by community PKI access authorization. Having such a structure will provide the IC with access to NSA/CSS and other IC-element metadata, as well as the internal 'federated query' that NSA analysts use to correlate these information elements and enrich the results with knowledge from our analytic reference files and other collaboration. This proposal will address existing IC-wide stated needs for additional NSA communications metadata elements and take the IC to an unprecedented level of information sharing.\n(S//NF) This initiative is in keeping with the 9/11 and President's WMD Commissions' recommendations on information sharing, the President's various Executive Orders related to information sharing, and your own announced goals on information sharing and collaboration.\n(S) This initiative was intended to facilitate a new level of sharing information across the IC for situational awareness, lead information, adversary analysis, and targeting and will add to the process of greater information sharing across the IC.\n\nRECOMMENDATION: (S//NF) I believe the time is right to designate an IC Executive Agency for sharing communications metadata as an integral part of a greater IC sharing environment. SIGINT metadata is a vast, rich source of information to build community collaboration and target knowledge and the emerging intelligence based target social network analysis discipline. NSA is prepared to accept this role and build the communications metadata coalition the IC needs for both current target tracking and future threat warning.\n(S//NF) To this end, my staffs have been meeting with CIA, DIA, FBI and DEA metadata users and technical experts to work out the details of this proposal.
