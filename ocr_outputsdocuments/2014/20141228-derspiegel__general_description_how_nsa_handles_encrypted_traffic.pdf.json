Today, anyone who uses the Internet can access web pages via the strong commercial encryption provided by HTTPS, and companies of all sizes can implement virtual private networks (VPN) to permit their employees to access sensitive or proprietary company data securely via an Internet connection from anywhere in the world. SID refers to this widespread encryption, which poses great challenges to SIGINT, as \"ubiguitous encryption.\"\n(TS//SI//REL) Meanwhile, NSA is doing plenty to stay ahead of this trend. To learn more about how SIGINT Mission threads 4 and 7 are addressing these encryption challenges and how these activities will help us meet the goals of the SIGINT Strategy, click on the links below.\n(TS//SI//REL) Due to the sensitive nature of these activities you will need access to the BULLRUN Community of Interest, which protects NSA's capabilities to defeat encryption of network communications. Inclusion in the BULLRUN CoI requires attending an indoctrination briefing. Please see the BULLRUN Indoctrination FAO for additional information.\n(TS//SI//REL) Click here to read about Mission Thread 4 : \"Countering the effects of strong commercial webmail encryption used by CT targets.\"\n(TS//SI//REL) Click here to learn more about how Mission Thread 7, \"Virtual Private Networks\" will help NSA distinguish intelligence-bearing encrypted communications from routine when Internet encryption has become ubiquitous.\n\nSpace\n2.
