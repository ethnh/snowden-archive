\n\n## CLASSIFICATION GUIDE TITLE/NUMBER: (U) NSA/CSS Quantum Computing Research, 10-25\n\nPUBLICATION DATE: (U) 21 September 2011\nOFFICE OF ORIGIN: (U) The Laboratory for Physical Sciences/R3\nPOC: (U//FOUO)\nORIGINAL CLASSIFICATION AUTHORITY: (U)\nC. Community Integration, Policy and Records\n(U//FOUO) This document establishes information security guidelines on NSA/CSS-sponsored research in the field of quantum computing (QC). The objectives defining the scope of this research activity are:\n\n1) $(\\mathrm{S} / / \\mathrm{REL})$ To assess if it is to NSA's benefit to continue research into whether practical-scale QC can be developed within a reasonable timeframe, to identify its most promising physical embodiment(s), and to formulate a credible scenario for its large-scale development;\n2) (U//FOUO) To gain an understanding of the computational cryptanalytic capabilities of quantum computers; and\n3) (U//FOUO) To identify practical cryptographic methods that are not susceptible to quantum computational attack.\n(S//REL) These guidelines do not cover the possibility of large-scale cryptologic QC development programs at NSA, but only the research and planning preliminary to, and in possible support of, such programs.\n(S//SI//REL) Much of the research in quantum computing is still very basic and is most effectively pursued in NSA-funded open research programs. These programs play a critical role as the major source of new ideas and for training future researchers in the field. However, NSA is pursuing more than just basic, unclassified research. NSA is also attempting to preserve the SIGINT potential of quantum computing (i.e., the cryptanalytic applications of QC) while simultaneously attempting to protect the information security of both the Government and private sectors against hostile QC attacks (i.e., the cryptographic, mission assurance applications of QC of interest to the Information Assurance community). These goals must be pursued at the classified level.\n(U//FOUO) There are several fundamental reasons for classifying QC research:\n4) (TS//SI//REL) To protect NSA's efforts to develop cryptanalytic QC to attack highgrade public key encryption systems by denying adversaries information concerning NSA's assessment of, and/or plans for, large-scale QC development;","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2200,"width":1700}},{"index":3,"markdown":"# TOP SECRET//SI//REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL \n\n2) (S//REL) To enable us to track our adversaries' degree of success or failure in similar QC development efforts; and\n3) (U//FOUO) To protect our own systems against adversarial cryptanalytic QC efforts.\n(S//REL) Based on this, the distinctions between unclassified and classified information contained in this guide attempt to differentiate between unclassified basic-level, academic-scale research of scientific interest, and more comprehensive classified research which might disclose techniques that may otherwise be possible to protect, or which might imply, rightly or wrongly, serious intent on NSA's part to pursue large-scale development of cryptanalytic quantum computers.\n\n| Description of Information | Classification/ <br> Markings | Category | Declass | Remarks |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| A.

Cryptology breaks out into two disciplines: cryptography (making or using codes/ciphers) and cryptanalysis (breaking codes/ciphers).\n(U) Detailed engineering design - Specifications of a set of qubits and the associated initialization, control, and measurement hardware and software at a level of detail commensurate with the requirements of industrial fabrication.\n(U) Fidelity - Precision of qubit operations such as initialization, logic gates, and readout.","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2200,"width":1700}},{"index":8,"markdown":"# TOP SECRET//SI//REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL \n\n(U) High-fidelity $\\mathbf{N}$-qubit Device - An engineered processing device that integrates $N$ coupled, high-fidelity physical qubits, i.e., qubits with fidelity of operations near or beyond the accuracy threshold for efficient error correction.\n(S//REL) Level A QC - Unclassified theoretical and/or experimental research in the design, physical implementation, and operation of quantum computers, as established by the Laboratory for Physical Sciences/R3.\n(S//REL) Level B QC - Classified theoretical and/or experimental research in the design, physical implementation, and operation of quantum computers, as established by the Laboratory for Physical Sciences/R3.
