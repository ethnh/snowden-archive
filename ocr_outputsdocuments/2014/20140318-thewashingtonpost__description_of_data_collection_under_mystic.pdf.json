Over collecting has significantly increased the latency of pri 1-2 content data. Because SCALAWAG is NSA's \\#1 provider of actionable SIGINT on [REDACTED COUNTRY NAME], measures had to be taken to alleviate pressure on the bandwidth and decrease latency of priority 1-2 data. In the summer of 2011, in an effort decrease the amount of voice content brought home, SSO deleted a large quantity of priority 4 and below tasking that was bringing content and according to the DOUBLEARROW database had not been \"touched\". Additionally, a change of priority 4 tasking to priority 6 was effected, again based on DOUBLEARROW results. As a result, the latency for primarily pri 1-2 had dropped considerably. However, these actions were still falling short because the volume of collection was increasing ....\n(S//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) On 15 December 2011, SSO collection and program management implemented a rule for SCALAWAG UTT tasking, that basically does not allow any \"Effective Collection Priority\" (ECP) pri 4 and below tasking. It must be understood that the priority of tasking in UTT IS NOT the same and straight forward as OCTAVE. Analysts must choose fields whose net result is priority 1-3.\nAdditionally, all UTT ECP pri 4 and below tasking was deleted. Since implementation, some TOPIS may have noted a decrease total volume in their SCALAWAG collection delivered to their NUCLEON accounts. Many SCALAWAG users are familiar with and have access to the RETROSPECTIVE retrieval tool (RETRO TOOL). The RETRO tool is a unique one-off capability that exists only at SCALAWAG. It allows analysts to go nominally 30-days into the past and retrieve audio of","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2200,"width":1700}},{"index":1,"markdown":"interest that was not tasked at the time of the original call. Analyst retrievals should be based on metadata, SRI found in FASCIA, that'll indicate there's a target of interest that's been detected in SCALAWAG's environment. Once the audio is identified, retrieved, and forwarded to your NUCLEON account, analysts would then consider tasking the number in UTT at ECP 1-3, based on the critical need for the data.\n(S//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Retrieval and forwarding via the RETRO TOOL will significantly reduce bandwidth and latency issues. It will also likely result in getting the audio data back to your NUCLEON account more quickly than if tasked at ECP 4 and below. We strongly request that TOPIs do not artificially inflate the priority of their tasking just to get numbers tasked. SIGDEV/Target development should be accomplished using the RETRO TOOL and subsequent tasking occur based on SIGDEV. TOPIs should make use of the RETRO TOOL whenever possible to retrieve the desired audio content. We do not have the luxury of task and forget.","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2200,"width":1700}}],"model":"mistral-ocr-2503-completion","usage_info":{"pages_processed":2,"doc_size_bytes":63420}}
