## Solutions

fax and data traffic transmitted over the INMARSAT-III satellite systems from Foreign Satellite and SCS/TRYST collection facilities
$\square$ ZODIACARRAY is the system that targets Broadband Global Area Network (BGAN), a digital service providing rates of up to 492 kbps . It is IP based activity to include voice. It is transmitted over the INMARSAT-IV satellite systems.
$\square$ CANYONDUST is a ground based INMARSAT mobile terminal geolocation system that computes geo-locations on all INMARSAT M, mini-M, M4, B, and C terminals, within its coverage region. The geo-locations are performed on the registration, access request, response bursts, or SCPC. The coverage region is defined as an area that is serviced by at least two INMARSAT satellites.
