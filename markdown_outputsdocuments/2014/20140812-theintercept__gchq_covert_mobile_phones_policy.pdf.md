# 1. POLICY STATEMENT 

### 1.1 Introduction

1.1.1 This policy defines the use of mobile phones by Tryst Travellers deployed overseas. It has been agreed between OPA-TAS and PISECGIAS and is to be read by all officers prior to deployment overseas.
1.1.2 It is OPA-TAS policy for officers to adopt best practice in the use of covert mobile phones when deployed overseas in order to ensure both their own personal security and GCHQ's operational security. This policy dictates the use of FCO provided non-attributable official and personal mobile phones by officers while on deployment.

## 2. Operating Rules

1.1.3 Official mobile phones are accountable items and must be signed for when taken from the OPA-TAS secure store.
1.1.4 The mobile phones and the accessories must be returned to OPA-TAS on return to the UK. Failure to do so may preclude future travel.
1.1.5 Official phones are to be used only for official business in country and MUST not be used to make personal calls to the UK. If a call is unavoidable then only out of area numbers can be called, these are:

- GSOC TRYST OOA - 0207
- TAS TRYST OOA - 0207
1.1.6 To avoid compromise the following must be adhered to:
- The covert mobile phones are equipped with BLUETOOTH and therefore they MUST not be switched on or used within a 50 -mile radius of Cheltenham and within this radius the battery must be removed from the phone.
- The covert mobile phone MUST NOT be recharged at the officer's home address or at temporary residence e.g. a hotel room, if it is within the 50 miles radius. If a phone needs to be charged then it is acceptable to do so either at the airport or at your destination.

- All contact with GCHQ should be via the OUT OF AREA numbers listed above.
- Calls are not allowed between a covert mobile phone and a family or friends home or mobile phone registered to an address within 50 miles of Cheltenham
- If you are carrying a covert mobile phone, you MUST NOT carry any personal communications device e.g. mobile phone, ipad, notebooks, PDAs, laptops etc.
- Calls between covert mobiles are permissible provided both are more than 50 miles from Cheltenham.
- If you believe the phone to have been compromised, stop using it and report the incident to TAS staff as soon as possible i.e. on return to the UK.


## 3. Procedures

1.1.7 The procedures for the storage and issue of the cover mobile phones are contained in Reference $C$.

## 4. Welfare

1.1.8 It is recognised that officers who are departing from, or have recently arrived in the UK may wish to advise family or friends of disruption to their travel plans. In such cases the officer must use payphones that are available in the airport. If a phone is not available at the airport, then during office hours contact the OPA-TAS OOA number, who will pass on the message onto the family member.
