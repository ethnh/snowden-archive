(TS//SI//REL) First-ever Computer Network Exploitation success against Turkish leadership is achieved.
(TS//SI//REL) Two heads are better than one, right? Well SIGINT development (SIGDEV) is living proof that collaboration really is efficient! SIGDEV analysts and target office elements (TOPI) within International Security Issues (ISI), with lots of help from their friends in SIGINT Strategy and Governance (SSG) and the Tailored Access Office (TAO), did something they'd never accomplished before; they achieved their first-ever computer network exploitation success against Turkish leadership! This successful process will serve as the prototype for future SIGINT target development efforts in ISI.
(S//SI//REL) The process of target development seems obvious enough, but this group added extreme collaboration to target templating and ended up with a winning combination. The ISI SIGDEV/TOPI effort focused development by identifying a 90-day surge team comprising SIGDEV, TOPI, SSG analysts (templating) and TAO. The team then employed target templating methodology to create a strategic action plan. This methodology served to focus exploitation efforts, research, analysis and collection planning. The data-visualization tool, facilitated collaboration across organizations and was used to

(C//SI//REL) The result was success in collecting communications-of-interest within 180 days from the implementation of the action plan to actual collection of the intended target and reporting of intelligence information! Because of the detailed nature of the documentation produced through this methodology, all pertinent players were able to carry out their role efficiently and to great effect.
