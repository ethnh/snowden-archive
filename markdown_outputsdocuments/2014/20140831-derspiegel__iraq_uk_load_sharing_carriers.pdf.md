# Summary: 

This informal report has been issued to highlight IRAQ/UK load sharing DTX600 carriers plus their corresponding return link ends.

The physical gateways are UK - IRAQ / IRAQ - UK, however, the UK is providing a logical gateway for the R.O.W (mainly Turkey, Syria, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Egypt \& UK) to/from Iraq.

C7 analysis confirms that G2BCR \& G2BBU are load-sharing traffic between R.O.W and IRAQ, and G2BCS \& G2BBV are load-sharing traffic between IRAQ and R.O.W.

Hits noted from numbers in Iraq (964), Iran (98), Syria (963), Turkey (90) \& UK (44)
