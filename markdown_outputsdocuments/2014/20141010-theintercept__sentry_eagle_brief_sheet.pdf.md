Protection Program - Sentry Eagle
# (S) NSA/CSS/JFCC-NW National Initiative Brief Sheet 

1. (S//NF) You are being indoctrinated on SENTRY EAGLE, the NSA/CSS and JFCC-NW's compartmented program protecting the highest and most sensitive level of information related to NSA/CSS's and JFCC-NW's support to the U.S. Government's efforts to protect America's cyberspace. America's cyberspace is the combination of U.S. National Security Systems, Military Systems, Intelligence Systems, Federal Government Systems, Critical Infrastructure Systems and all other U.S. systems (private industry, academia and private citizen.)
2. (S//NF) NSA/CSS's effort to protect America's cyberspace encompasses the combination of all abilities to detect nation and non-nation attacks on U.S. cyberspace via active and passive SIGINT and Information Assurance means. JFCC-NW's effort to protect America's cyberspace encompasses the efforts to plan, synchronize, and when tasked, attack an adversary's cyber space via Computer Network Attack. The combination of these two efforts constitutes NSA/CSS's and JFCC-NW's Core Computer Network Operations (CNO) Secrets.
3. (TS//SI//NF) In order for NSA/CSS and JFCC-NW to accomplish, along with other U.S. and foreign government agencies/elements, the protection of America's cyberspace, NSA/JFCC-NW must combine the full capabilities of authorized Computer Network Operations capabilities (SIGINT, Computer Network Exploitation (CNE); Information Assurance, Computer Network Defense (CND), and Network Warfare, Computer Network Attack (CNA)) and all supporting activities.
4. (TS//SI//NF) SENTRY EAGLE and its subordinate programs protect the combined facts related to NSA/CSS and JFCC-NW's abilities to conduct CNO operations. It encompasses the most sensitive aspects of NSA/CSS's: relationships with industry (U.S. and foreign) and the U.S. Information Operations/CNO community; ability to exploit enciphered communications; ability to conduct CNE; ability to conduct CND; and, relationships with Human Intelligence (HUMINT) Agencies.
5. (TS//SI//NF) These NSA/CSS and JFCC-NW Core CNO Secrets are being provided to you based upon your "need to know" as determined by the Director, NSA/Chief, Central Security Service and Commander, JFCC-NW. While many of the facts in this briefing are contained in separate NSA/CSS Exceptionally Controlled Information (ECIs) or DOD Special Access Programs (SAPs) structures, no other program combines the totality of all these facts into one overarching program. The facts contained in this program constitute a combination of the greatest number of highly sensitive facts related to NSA/CSS's overall cryptologic mission. As such, depending upon
# TOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN//20310524 <br> DRAFT 

your mission need-to-know or management position, you may be read on for one, a combination of two or more, or all aspects of SENTRY EAGLE.
6. (TS//SI//NF) Individuals briefed into SENTRY EAGLE may not share information regarding this program with those not read into this program, or with foreign nationals, including those with whom NSA/CSS has Second and Third Party relationships. Depending upon a specific fact, you may share such a fact with foreign partners as noted on the SENTRY EAGLE or subordinate classification guides as paragraph marked or within specific NSA/CSS SAP or ECI channels. Under no circumstances will you share the totality of SENTRY EAGLE nor facts that are marked NOFORN.
7. (S) SENTRY EAGLE material must be protected within this compartment and discussed only with cleared personnel on a need-to-know basis. Disclosure of SENTRY EAGLE information to non-indoctrinated personnel may result in disciplinary action to include criminal prosecution. When sharing SENTRY EAGLE compartmented information, it will be protected with PKI when transmitted via electronic means or with sealed, by name envelopes when transmitted via hard copy.
# (U)/FOUO) COVERNAME: SENTRY EAGLE 

## (U//FOUO) TRIGRAPH: SEE

## (U//FOUO) CONTROL AUTHORITY CONTACT INFORMATION:

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

## (U) INFORMATION REQUIRING SENTRY EAGLE PROTECTION:

(TS//SI//NF) Details related to the combination of NSA/CSS's and JFCC-NW's abilities to conduct CNO in the defense of America's cyberspace.

## (U) VALUE OF SEE:

(TS//SI//NF) Protecting sensitive NSA/CSS industrial and human intelligence relationships; SIGINT exploitation of adversary computers and computer networks and infrastructure and their use of encipherment; Information Assurance defense of U.S. Government National Security Systems; and, JFCC-NW's Computer Network Attack mission capabilities.

## (U) JUSTIFICATION FOR SENTRY EAGLE PROTECTION:

(TS//SI//NF) Unauthorized disclosure of NSA/CSS relationships with industry (U.S. and foreign) and the U.S. Information Operations/CNO community; ability to exploit enciphered communications; ability to conduct CNE; ability to conduct CND; and, relationships with Human Intelligence (HUMINT) Agencies will cause exceptionally grave damage to U.S. national security. The loss of this information could critically compromise highly sensitive cryptologic U.S. and foreign relationships, multi-year past and future NSA investments, and the ability to exploit foreign adversary cyberspace while protecting U.S cyberspace.
