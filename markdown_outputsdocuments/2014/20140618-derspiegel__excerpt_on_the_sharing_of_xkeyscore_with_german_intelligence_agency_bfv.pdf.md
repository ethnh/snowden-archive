(TS//SI//NF) Germany: Provision of XKEYSCORE software to the BY will expand their ability to support NSA as we jointly prosecute CT targets. Technical support for XKEYSCORE will be provided by the BND as it involves CES equities that a non-technical partner could inadvertently place at risk. Based on our CA relationship with the BND, they are well aware of, and able to, protect those equities.
