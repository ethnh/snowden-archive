(S//SI) In early 2003, NSA/CSS Europe (NCEUR) and the Geospatial Exploitation and Counterterrorism Product Lines initiated a Forward Production effort (at NCEUR) to support our national goals and strategy in North Africa. Among those goals was to enable African governments to police their own borders, sustain or enhance stability and make it clear that their countries were an environment hostile to terrorist organizations and their supporters.
(S//SI) This small investment of five-to-six analysts has provided a significant return: Forward Production and headquarters analysts* were able to report the predicted movement of EUCOM Senior Staff and U.S. Ambassadors in the region used this information to engage and enable regional governments to conduct successful counterterrorism operations. Intelligence generated by this Forward Production-NSAW partnership has been responsible for the capture or kill of over 40 terrorists and has helped achieve GWOT and regional policy successes in Africa.
(S//SI) While based on the skills of the forward-deployed analysts as supported by NSA HQ, two other overarching factors contributed to the effort's success. These factors are:

- collocation with the primary regional implementer or action arm of the US Government as well as supporting elements, and
- an aggressive effort to release SIGINT to foreign governments supporting truly non-traditional customers (e.g., governments in Algeria, Mali, and Mauritania).
(S//SI) Forward Production's effectiveness is based on collocation and integration with operational planners and teaming with all-source customers and partners. This allows Forward Production analysts to better anticipate requirements, to provide better-tailored products and services, to better operate in the customers' decision cycle, and to better understand customer needs.
(S//SI) As the title of DIRgram-337 states "It's About Relating, Not Disseminating" and NCEUR forward-deployed analysts as "our expeditionary force inside our customers' information space..." are better enabling CT operations and reaching analytic conclusions not otherwise possible. The Forward Production cell at NCEUR is serving as a model for operational partnering and analytic collaboration within the customer's environment.
(S//SI) This Forward Production model will be implemented on an industrial scale when the European Security Center (ESC) in Darmstadt, Germany, becomes fully operational. The ESC is the realization of a significant investment by US Army Europe (USAREUR) and Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM) to perform SIGINT analysis and production against national, theater, and tactical requirements within the customer domain.
