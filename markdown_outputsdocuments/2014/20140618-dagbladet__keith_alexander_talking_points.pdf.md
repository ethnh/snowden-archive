DIR Opening Remarks Guidance for DP1
The DIR typically gives Opening Remarks for the following three conferences (NORUSA, DENUSA, and SWEDUSA) but he may be asked to do others in which case the same guidance should be followed.

DIR Staff has given us guidelines to follow for the Opening Remarks Talking Points. Note that we had wanted to simply include these Opening Remarks Talking Points in our Exec Sum for the visit, but DIR Staff told us they needed a separate document for the Opening Remarks and it needed to be in a specific format. That format is below (example provided is from DENUSA last year).

The Remarks should outline things that have been accomplished since the last conference, as well as things we want to get accomplished in this conference/the upcoming year. We should also add anything else FAD wants DIRNSA to convey.

Once the Opening Remarks Talking Points are approved by appropriate DP1 leadership (at least DP1 Office Chief level), the CDO should provide the Opening Remarks in the attached format to the following aliases at least 3 business days in advance of the event:

TO: DL DIRSPEAK

CC: D DIR Staff, DP1 Office Chief/Deputy
Per guidance from DIR Staff, it is the responsibility of the folks on the DIRCOMMS alias to print out the remarks on 5X8 cards and provide to the DIR staff.
