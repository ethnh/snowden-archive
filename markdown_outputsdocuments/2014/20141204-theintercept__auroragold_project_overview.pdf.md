# (U//FOUO) AURORAGOLD 

(S//SI//REL) Project Overview: The mission of the AURORAGOLD (AG) project is to maintain data about international GSM/UMTS networks for the Wireless Portfolio Program Office (WPMO), the Target Technology Trends Center (T3C/SSG4), and their customers. Analysis of this data supports:
a) An understanding of the current state,
b) Trending, or time-series analysis, from the past through to the future, and
c) Forecasting of the evolution of global GSM/UMTS-based networks.

This analysis and developmental activity is currently focusing only on GSM/UMTS infrastructure, voice-data convergence, UMTS technology migration, and UMTS technology deployments. Coincident beneficiaries of this mission are, among others, other NSA SIGDEV elements, protocol exploitation elements, and Five-Eyes Partner SIGDEV organizations.
(C//REL) Alignment: Supports NSA's and SID's imperative to "Know the Future."
(C//REL) Sponsors: WPMO/S3W
(C//REL) Customers: WPMO/S3W; T3C/SSG4; Various S3 collections organizations; numerous IC organizations
(C//REL) Architecture and Infrastructure: Custom-built application based on OZONE framework, using GOLDENCARRIAGE corporate servers for all application and data storage

## (S//SI//REL) Corpus:

Will contain:

- Unclassified: Complete replica of Informa Telecoms and Media's World Cellular Information Service (WCIS) queryable database to eventually compare data against that collected from SIGINT
- Classified: SIGINT-collected IR. 21 (International Roaming agreements) documents from around the world, parsed of their information, analyzed, and giving users the ability to trend this information over time (time-series analysis). In addition, e-mail selectors from within IR. 21 s and from SIGINT metadata captured, analyzed and managed back into the SIGINT system for enhanced collection


## (C//REL) Content:

- Portion of the WCIS data available via NSANet GUI; remainder to be completed within 2-3 months - Currently, Phase 1 contains a small database of worldwide wireless networks being compared against IR. 21 s from SIGINT to establish our "baseline"


## (C//REL) Capabilities:

- Soon, complete WCIS repository to be copied to NSANet for querying by all NSA and 2P Partners
- Later, agile querying through entire IR. 21 and WCIS databases, with capability to perform timeseries analysis via visualization application
