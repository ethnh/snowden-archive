NSA Integree at GCHO

(U//FOUO) SIGINT analysts: We have all heard about Big Data; now you can get Big Access to Big Data.
(TS//SI//REL) What happens when one site contains more data than all other XKEYSCOREs combined? At more than 10 times larger than the next biggest XKEYSCORE,* TEMPORA at GCHO is the world's largest XKEYSCORE and the NSA workforce is now getting greater access to it. This massive site uses over 1000 machines to process and make available to analysts more than 40 billion pieces of content a day. And starting today skilled NSA XKEYSCORE users can get access to the TEMPORA database via the XKS-Central interface.
(TS//SI//REL) What is TEMPORA? TEMPORA is GCHQ's XKEYSCORE "Internet buffer" which exploits the most valuable Internet links available to GCIIQ. TEMPORA provides a powerful discovery capability against Middle East, North African and European target sets (among others). Analysts who have benefited from GCIIQ Special Source accesses like INCENSER or MUSCULAR will almost certainly benefit from TEMPORA.
(TS//SI//REL) How valuable is TEMPORA? The value and utility of TEMPORA were proven early into a 5 -month evaluation that began this past March. With a limited user base of 300 analysts, TEMPORA became the second most valuable XKEYSCORE access for discovery. Additionally, this small group of analysts produced over 200 end-product reports and provided critical support to SIGINT, defensive, and cyber mission elements.
(TS//SI//REL) Why TEMPORA? TEMPORA provides the ability to do content-based discovery and development across a large array of high-priority signals. Similar to other XKEYSCORE deployments, TEMPORA effectively "slows down" a large chunk of Internet data, providing analysts with three working days to use the surgical toolkit of the GENESIS language to discover data that otherwise would have been missed. This tradecraft of content-based discovery using the GENESIS language is a critical tool in the analyst's discovery tool kit, and nicely complements the existing and well-known tradecrafts of strong selection targeting and bulk meta-data analysis.
(TS//SI//REL) How do I get an account? To comply with GCHQ policy and to ensure users are successful in such a large-scale environment, TEMPORA access reguires users to be proficient with XKEYSCORE. At NSA this is achieved via the completion of various XKS Skilz achievements. Beginning today, users will see a new "TEMPORA" achievement, which reguires users to have remained current with their UK Legalities training (OVSCI700), be a level 3 or higher XKS Skilz user, and have used GENESIS by either guerying or authoring fingerprints. Users who meet those criteria will automatically be given TEMPORA access in their XKS Central account.
(S//SI//REL) What do I need to know about using TEMPORA? Although TEMPORA will appear as an additional database in XKS Central, there are some important items analysts need to be aware of when they search this database. Analysts are asked to pay close attention to details concerning the UK Legality requirements on the TEMPORA user-guidance wiki page. TEMPORA gueries must comply with both UK and U.S. legal requirements, and the analytic community must ensure we are using this access wisely and compliantly.
(S//SI//REL) How can I learn more about using XKEYSCORE? If you'd like to get TEMPORA access but need some help fulfilling the proficiency requirements, the XKEYSCORE Outreach Team is ready to help. The team recently added an additional round of XKEYSCORE training sessions on ERS, which users can sign up for via this link. Also, analysts can find great tradecraft and training tips via the XKEYBLOG, or they can contact the team directly at DL XKS_Mentoring.

(U) Notes:

* (S//SI/REL) XKEYSCORE is a computer-network exploitation system that combines high-speed filtering with SIGDEV. XKEYSCORE performs filtering and selection to enable analysts to quickly find information they need based on what they already know, but it also performs SIGDEV. functions such as target development to allow analysts to discover new sources of information.
