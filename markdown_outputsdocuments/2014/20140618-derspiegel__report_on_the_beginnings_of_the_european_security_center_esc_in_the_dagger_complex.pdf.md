# (U//FOUO) European Security Center to Begin Operations 

FROM: USA
Chief, Operations Division, Army Cryptologic Operations (ACO)
Run Date: 03/29/2004
(S) A new tactical SIGINT producer will soon be up and running in Europe. On 10 March, MG (SID) and MG of the Army's Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM) signed the Concept of Operations for the European Security
Center (ESC), setting the stage for an April start of formal SIGINT operations in Darmstadt, Germany The ESC (USM-44) will perform SIGINT operations primarily in support of U.S. Army Europe and the European Command, but it will also conduct mutually beneficial, cooperative missions with various SID Product Lines.
(C) The ESC is a fixed site facility that will provide crisis support to military operations throughout the European Command theater, which includes not only Europe, but also much of Africa and parts of the Middle East. Working with a collocated INSCOM Theater SIGINT Battalion (TSB), the ESC will also provide an on-demand survey capability and deploy tailored front-end collection equipment. It will be a complete production facility, performing collection, processing, analysis and dissemination.
(C) The Center will also support theater SIGINT soldiers assigned at tactical echeions. It will serve both as a formal training center where those soldiers routinely train and maintain technical and language skills, and as a deployment center for soldiers who directly support contingency missions and combat operations.
(C) The ESC is initially staffed by SIGINT soldiers of INSCOM's 66th Military Intelligence Group, augmented by Army civilians and contractors. In the near term, they will be assisted by SID augmentees who possess critical skills, with the appropriate level of long-term SID support to be assessed as the ESC matures. Initially an "Army" organization, the ESC is a flexible construct that could potentially host personnel and missions from other Services and Agencies.
(C) The ESC is housed in two new SCIF** structures (over 10,000 square feet) adjacent to an existing Army Operations SCIF that houses other Army theater intelligence support missions, allowing an enhanced all-source effort against theater requirements. Current ESC systems and capabilities include 59 Distributed Common Ground Station - Army (DCGS-A) workstations, HIGHCASTLE (for voice processing and analysis and reporting), the TROJAN CLASSIC XXI collection, processing, analysis and reporting system, and an Emitter Mapping suite. Planned reconfiguration includes a "Linguarium", a novel construct to consolidate, focus and enhance voice analyst capabilities and productivity.
