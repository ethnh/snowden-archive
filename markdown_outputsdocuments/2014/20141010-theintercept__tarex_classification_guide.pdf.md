## ORIGINAL CLASSIFICATION AUTHORITY: (U//FOUO) Teresa H. Shea, Signals Intelligence Director

(S//NF) The NSA/CSS Target Exploitation (TAREX) Program conducts worldwide clandestine Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) close-access operations and overt and clandestine Human Intelligence (HUMINT) operations in direct support of the United States Cryptologic System (USCS). TAREX Program activities are executed under dual NSA/CSS SIGINT authority and U.S. Army HUMINT authority. NSA/CSS establishes, funds, and directs TAREX activities, and these activities are only conducted in response to validated NSA/CSS requirements. The HUMINT community is responsible for executing TAREX operations.
(U//FOUO) This classification guide only addresses the SIGINT portion of the TAREX Program. Refer to the U.S. Army HUMINT Classification Guide, dated 8 February 2008, for guidance on TAREX HUMINT activities. Contact this guide's POC for a copy of the U.S. Army HUMINT Classification Guide.
