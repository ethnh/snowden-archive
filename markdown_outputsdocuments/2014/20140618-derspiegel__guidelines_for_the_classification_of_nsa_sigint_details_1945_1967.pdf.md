## (U) ORIGINAL CLASSIFICATION AUTHORITY: SIGINT Director.

(U) This classification guide describes the SIGINT material that is dated from 16 August 1945 - 31 December 1967 and warrants protection for more than 50 years. It supersedes all prior guidance relating to material originating during this timeframe. This guidance pertains to NSA/CSS as well as to its predecessor organizations.

| Description of Information | Classification/Markings | Reason | Declass | Remarks |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| 1. (U) All sources- and methodsrelated metadata added to SIGINT product reports by NSA/CSS or included in NSA/CSS metrics reports | CONFIDENTIAL/RELTO <br> USA, FVEY at a minimum | $\begin{aligned} & 50 \times 1 \\ & 50 \times 3 \\ & 50 \times 6 \end{aligned}$ | *75 years from date of material | (U//FOUO) This includes information such as SIGINT addresses (SIGADs), Producer Designator Digraphs (PDDGs), Case Notations (CASNs), RASIN Manual designators, intercept designators, SRIs, Crypt System Titles, Intelligence Source Indicators (ISIs), Time of Intercept (TOI), Communications Lanes (foreign FROM/TO entities), Message Telex numbers assigned by foreign target, number of messages collected for a specific target, number of messages decrypted for a specific target, etc. <br> (U) Exceptions: For the period of the Vietnam conflict (through 31 December 1967) - all metadata for otherwise releasable reports in which the targeted entity was a participant in the Vietnam conflict is UNCLASSIFIED. <br> (U/FOUO) The methodologies used by |
|  |  |  | NSA/CSS to log, track, account for, and analyze collection prior to 1968 are still used today. Revealing this "who," "when," "where," and "how" could provide an adversary with a great deal of insight into NSA's targets, collection sites, and other collection- and analysisrelated information that is still being used today. <br> (U) Various levels of harm to national security can be expected if this material were to be declassified, depending on the particular information being revealed. |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| 2. (S//NF) Information revealing the fact of NSA/CSS targeting, collecting, or processing the communications of these specific foreign countries/international organizations: <br> - Algeria after 31 Dec 1946 <br> - Belgium after 31 Dec 1946 <br> - France after 31 Dec 1946 <br> - Germany (i.e., West Germany) after 31 Dec 1946 <br> - Netherlands after 31 Dec 1946 <br> - Norway after 31 Dec 1946 <br> - Saudi Arabia after 31 Dec 1946 <br> - Sweden after 31 Dec 1946 <br> - Tunisia after 31 Dec 1946 <br> - Turkey after 31 Dec 1946 <br> - Taiwan (Formosa) after 31 Dec 1949 <br> - Italy after 31 Dec 1947 <br> - Jordan after 31 Dec 1947 <br> - Denmark after 31 Dec 1953 <br> - South Korea after 31 Dec 1953 <br> - Japan after 31 Dec 1954 <br> - Austria after 31 Dec 1955 <br> - Israel for any timeframe (see | SECRET//REL TO USA, FVEY at a minimum | $\begin{aligned} & \text { 75X1 } \\ & 75 \mathrm{X} 3 \\ & 75 \mathrm{X} 6 \end{aligned}$ | *75 years from either the date of material or the end of the particular partnership, whichever is longer | (U) The fact of NSA/CSS targeting, collecting, or processing against any nation not listed as classified through 1967 is UNCLASSIFIED. <br> (U) Revealing these specific targets will enable adversaries to deduce the strength and range of NSA/CSS's capabilities at that time. When there is direct link between the communications systems used then and those used today, the targets can adopt blanket denial practices not currently used because they simply do not appreciate how well their signals are currently being exploited by NSA/CSS. In addition, certain historical targets are also (and were in the timeframe covered by this guide) SIGINT partners, and revealing that NSA/CSS targeted nations that are current partners could have an immediate negative effect on those relationships. <br> (U) The fact that NSA/CSS processed intercepted Israeli communications during the USS Liberty incident (24 |
| - remark for specific exception) <br> - Pakistan for any timeframe <br> - Singapore for any timeframe <br> - all international organizations |  |  |  | May - 8 June 1967) is <br> UNCLASSIFIED. <br> (U) Serious or exceptionally <br> grave damage to national <br> security can be expected if <br> this material were to be <br> declassified, depending on <br> the particular information <br> being revealed. |

| 3. (S//NF) Information revealing <br> the fact of NSA/CSS targeting, <br> collecting, or processing the <br> communications of a Second <br> Party country | SECRET//NOFORN | 75X1 <br> 75 X 3 <br> 75 X 6 <br> 75 X 9 | *75 years <br> from either <br> the date of <br> material or <br> the end of <br> the <br> partnership, <br> whichever <br> is longer | (S//NF) Second Party <br> partnerships are among <br> NSA/CSS's strongest, oldest, <br> and most important. <br> Revealing the fact that <br> NSA/CSS targeted their <br> communications at any time <br> would most likely have <br> serious implications for, and <br> could cause irreparable <br> damage to, the partnerships. |
| 4. (U) The identities of specific <br> NSA/CSS Third Party SIGINT <br> partners | SECRET//REL TO USA, <br> FVEY at a minimum | 75X1 <br> 75 X 3 <br> 75 X 6 | *75 years <br> from either <br> the date of <br> material or <br> the end of <br> the <br> particular <br> partnership, <br> whichever <br> is longer | (U//FOUO) NSA/CSS's <br> Third Party partners provide <br> NSA with unique and <br> valuable insights on <br> counterterrorism, combating <br> proliferation, and regional <br> stability issues. They also <br> often provide NSA/CSS <br> information about each other. <br> Although they may suspect <br> they were targets prior to <br> 1968, their level of <br> cooperation with NSA is <br> expected to diminish if it <br> became a known fact. <br> Conversely, if information <br> that NSA/CSS has relating to <br> these countries that is outside <br> the scope of the partnerships <br> were to be released, the <br> countries could gain insight <br> into NSA's other SIGINT <br> capabilities, and could also <br> become aware of information <br> that NSA/CSS has not been <br> sharing. The future of <br> NSA/CSS's Third Party <br> SIGINT foreign partnerships <br> would be at stake. |
|  |  |  |  | (U) Serious or exceptionally grave damage to national security can be expected if this material were to be declassified, depending on the particular information being revealed. |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| 5. (U) The fact that NSA/CSS shared particular SIGINT material with a specific Second Party partner, when the partner is identifiable | CONFIDENTIAL//REL TO USA, FVEY at a minimum | $\begin{aligned} & 75 \mathrm{X} 1 \\ & 75 \mathrm{X} 3 \\ & 75 \mathrm{X} 6 \\ & 75 \mathrm{X} 9 \end{aligned}$ | *75 years from either the date of material or the end of the particular partnership, whichever is longer | (U//FOUO) NSA/CSS's Second Party partnerships are extraordinarily close, and in some cases it is impossible to tell where one partner's work ends and another's starts. In many cases, for a variety of reasons originating within the respective partner's government, Second Party partners insist that their involvement in specific projects or operations must not be released. The UKUSA agreement, signed in 1946, mandates that the Second Parties respect each others' preferences in these cases. <br> (U) Various levels of harm to national security can be expected if this material were to be declassified, depending on the particular information being revealed. |
| 6. (U) The fact that NSA/CSS shared particular SIGINT material with a specific Third Party partner, when the partner is identifiable | SECRET//REL TO USA, FVEY at a minimum | $\begin{aligned} & 75 \mathrm{X} 1 \\ & 75 \mathrm{X} 3 \\ & 75 \mathrm{X} 6 \end{aligned}$ | *75 years from either the date of material or the end of the particular partnership, whichever is longer | (U//FOUO) NSA/CSS's <br> Third Party partners provide NSA with unique and valuable insights on counterterrorism, combating proliferation, and regional stability issues. If it were revealed that NSA/CSS shared particular information with specific Third Party partners (essentially revealing the countries with which it had Third Party SIGINT partnerships prior to 1968), the future of its Third Party SIGINT foreign partnerships would be at stake. <br> (U) Serious or exceptionally grave damage to national security can be expected if |
|  |  |  |  | this material were to be declassified, depending on the particular information being revealed. |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| 7. (U) Information revealing NSA/CSS targeting, collecting, or processing diplomatic or leadership communications of a specific foreign country/countries, international organization, group of individuals, or individual (post 31 December 1946) | SECRET//REL TO USA, FVEY at a minimum | $\begin{aligned} & 50 \mathrm{X} 1 \\ & 50 \mathrm{X} 3 \\ & 50 \mathrm{X} 7 \end{aligned}$ | *75 years from date of material | (U) Exceptions: <br> - (U) diplomatic/leadership communications collected during and related to the Cuban Missile Crisis (1 January 1959-31 December 1963) are UNCLASSIFIED <br> - (U) North Vietnamese, Laotian, or Cambodian diplomatic/leadership communications related to the Vietnam conflict and collected between 1 January 1960 and 31 December 1975 are UNCLASSIFIED <br> (U//FOUO) Indicating whose diplomatic/leadership communications NSA/CSS targeted, collected, and/or processed prior to 1968 would cause diplomatic challenges for the U.S., and could also enable a targeted country that is still using similar communications systems to change their systems, thereby denying NSA/CSS valuable intelligence. <br> (U) Serious or exceptionally grave damage to national security can be expected if this material were to be declassified, depending on the particular information being revealed. |
| 8. (U//FOUO) Information revealing NSA/CSS targeting, collecting, or processing of specific international commercial (ILC) communications (post 31 December 1946) | SECRET//REL TO USA, FVEY at a minimum | $\begin{aligned} & 50 \mathrm{X} 1 \\ & 50 \mathrm{X} 3 \end{aligned}$ | *75 years from date of material | (U//FOUO) Indicating whose ILC communications NSA/CSS targeted, collected, and/or processed prior to 1968 could also enable a target that is still using similar communications systems to change its systems, thereby denying NSA/CSS valuable intelligence. |
|  |  |  |  | (U) Serious or exceptionally grave damage to national security can be expected if this material were to be declassified, depending on the particular information being revealed. |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| 9. (U) Information that contains or reveals foreign SIGINT partner equities | CONFIDENTIAL//REL TO <br> USA, FVEY at a minimum | $\begin{aligned} & 75 \mathrm{X} 1 \\ & 75 \mathrm{X} 3 \\ & 75 \mathrm{X} 6 \\ & 75 \mathrm{X} 9 \end{aligned}$ | *75 years from either the date of material or the end of the particular partnership, whichever is longer | (U//FOUO) This includes the basic "fact of" specific Third Party partnerships, names of personnel associated with partner organizations (Second or Third Party), indications of projects that were worked with specific foreign partners (Second or Third Party), collection locations in partner nations (Second or Third Party), etc. <br> (U//FOUO) NSA/CSS's foreign partners provide NSA with unique and valuable insights on a wide variety of issues that are critical to U.S. national security (e.g., counterterrorism, combating proliferation, and regional stability). It is a given that they need to protect their equities as vehemently as NSA/CSS protects its own. If NSA/CSS were to release information that revealed the equities of its foreign partners (Second as well as Third Parties), the future of its SIGINT foreign partnerships would be at stake. <br> (U) Various levels of harm to national security can be expected if this material were to be declassified, depending on the particular information being revealed. |
| 10. (U//FOUO) Information revealing specific overseas collection and High-Frequency Direction Finding (HFDF) locations that remain open today | CONFIDENTIAL//REL TO <br> USA, FVEY at a minimum | $\begin{aligned} & 75 \mathrm{X} 1 \\ & 75 \mathrm{X} 3 \\ & 75 \mathrm{X} 6 \end{aligned}$ | *75 years from either the date of material or closure of site, whichever is longer | (U//FOUO) Revealing specific overseas collection and HFDF locations could adversely affect Third Party SIGINT partnerships and reveal NSA/CSS's HFDF capability strengths and weaknesses. Such revelations |
|  |  |  |  | would identify NSA/CSS's <br> Third Party partners and enable its adversaries to develop countermeasures against its strengths and exploit its weaknesses. <br> (U) Various levels of harm to national security can be expected if this material were to be declassified, depending on the particular information being revealed. |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| 11. (S//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) The fact that NSA/CSS conducted/conducts covert SIGINT operations at unspecified officially flagged U.S. facilities abroad | SECRET//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY | $\begin{aligned} & 75 \mathrm{X} 1 \\ & 75 \mathrm{X} 3 \\ & 75 \mathrm{X} 6 \\ & 75 \mathrm{X} 7 \end{aligned}$ | *75 years from either the date of material or end of overall activity, whichever is longer | (S//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Revealing the fact that NSA/CSS conducted covert SIGINT operations from officially flagged U.S. facilities abroad would impair the effectiveness of intelligence methods currently in use; would reveal information that would cause serious harm to relations between the United States and a foreign government, or to ongoing diplomatic activities of the United States; and could impair the ability to provide protection services to those U.S. Government officials authorized protection (e.g., President, Vice President). |
| 12. (S//REL TO USA, FVEY) The association of a specific location with an SCS site, the existence of which is releasable to Second Party partners | TOP SECRET//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY | $\begin{aligned} & 75 \mathrm{X} 1 \\ & 75 \mathrm{X} 3 \\ & 75 \mathrm{X} 6 \\ & 75 \mathrm{X} 7 \end{aligned}$ | *75 years from either the date of material or end of overall activity, whichever is longer | (S//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Revealing that NSA/CSS conducted covert SIGINT operations from specific officially flagged U.S. facilities abroad would impair the effectiveness of intelligence methods currently in use; would reveal information that would cause serious harm to relations between the U.S. and a foreign government, or to ongoing diplomatic activities of the U.S.; and could impair the ability to provide protection services to those U.S. Government officials authorized protection (e.g., President, Vice President). |
|  |  |  |  | (U) Exceptionally grave damage to national security can be expected if this material were to be declassified. |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| 13. (S//REL TO USA, FVEY) The association of a specific location with an SCS site that is NOFORN | TOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN | $\begin{aligned} & 75 \mathrm{X} 1 \\ & 75 \mathrm{X} 3 \\ & 75 \mathrm{X} 6 \\ & 75 \mathrm{X} 7 \end{aligned}$ | *75 years from either the date of material or end of overall activity, whichever is longer | (S//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Revealing that NSA/CSS conducted covert SIGINT operations from specific officially flagged U.S. facilities abroad would immediately impair the effectiveness of intelligence methods currently in use; would reveal information that would cause serious harm to relations between the United States and a foreign government, or to ongoing diplomatic activities of the United States; and could impair the ability to provide protection services to those U.S. Government officials authorized protection (e.g., President, Vice President). <br> (U) Exceptionally grave damage to national security can be expected if this material were to be declassified. |
| 14. (U) Information revealing specific sources and methods used by NSA/CSS to target, collect, and/or process SIGINT and that are currently used today | CONFIDENTIAL//REL TO USA, FVEY at a minimum | $\begin{aligned} & 50 \mathrm{X} 1 \\ & 50 \mathrm{X} 3 \\ & 50 \mathrm{X} 6 \end{aligned}$ | *75 years from date of material | (U//FOUO) NSA/CSS uses the same sources and methods to obtain SIGINT today as it did prior to 1968. Revealing the specific sources and methods used by NSA/CSS to target, collect, and/or process SIGINT would enable targets to adopt blanket denial practices not used today because they simply do not appreciate how well their signals are currently being exploited by NSA/CSS. <br> (U) See Entry 31 for additional information. |
| 15. (TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Information revealing the fact of, as well as details relating to, NSA/CSS conducting covert | TOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN | $\begin{aligned} & 50 \mathrm{X} 1 \\ & 50 \mathrm{X} 3 \\ & 50 \mathrm{X} 6 \end{aligned}$ | *75 years from date of material | (TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) NSA/CSS's covert SIGINT activities, such as SIGINT enabling and the use |
| SIGINT activities, including material dealing with SIGINT enabling; cover plans, programs, and mechanisms; and/or clandestine SIGINT |  |  |  | of particular cover mechanisms, are much the same today as they were prior to 1968. Revealing the specific covert activities would nullify the particular programs where they are successfully used today. Targets would adopt blanket denial practices not used today because they simply do not appreciate how NSA/CSS's covert activities support SIGINT successes. <br> (U) Exceptionally grave damage to national security can be expected if this material were to be declassified. |

| 16. (U) TICOM documents dated prior to 31 December 1967 where the acquired document was originally created by the U.S. or a Second Party partner and was in the possession of an "enemy" organization. | CONFIDENTIAL//REL TO USA, FVEY at a minimum | 50X1 <br> 50X3 <br> 50X6 <br> 50X9 | *75 years from date of material | (U) TICOM documents should only be released if they would have been released by the U.S. or Second Party directly. <br> (U) TICOM documents that may be declassified and released include acquired code books and the description of applications of techniques to cryptographic systems. <br> (U//FOUO) TICOM was a joint Five Eyes effort. NSA/CSS's Second Party partnerships are extraordinarily close, and in some cases it is impossible to tell where one partner's work ends and another's starts. In many cases, for a variety of reasons originating within the respective partner's government, Second Party partners insist that their involvement in specific projects or operations must not be released. The UKUSA agreement mandates that the Second Parties respect each others' preferences in these cases. |

| 17. (U) TICOM interrogation reports | CONFIDENTIAL//REL TO USA, FVEY, at a minimum | $\begin{aligned} & 50 \mathrm{X} 1 \\ & 50 \mathrm{X} 3 \\ & 50 \mathrm{X} 6 \\ & 50 \mathrm{X} 9 \end{aligned}$ | *75 years from date of material | (U) TICOM documents should only be released if they would have been released by the U.S. or Second Party directly. <br> (U) In some cases, TICOM interrogation reports remain not releasable due to BRUSA agreements to protect personal information whose release could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy of a living person. <br> (U//FOUO) TICOM was a joint Five Eyes effort. NSA/CSS's Second Party partnerships are extraordinarily close, and in some cases it is impossible to tell where one partner's work ends and another's starts. In many cases, for a variety of reasons originating within the respective partner's government, Second Party partners insist that their involvement in specific projects or operations must not be released. The UKUSA agreement mandates that the Second Parties respect each others' preferences in these cases. <br> (U) Various levels of harm to national security can be expected if this material were to be declassified, depending on the particular information being revealed. |
| 18. (U) ELINT material related to radar/weapons systems that are still used today | S//REL TO USA, FVEY at a minimum | $\begin{aligned} & 50 \mathrm{X} 1 \\ & 50 \mathrm{X} 3 \end{aligned}$ | *75 years from date of material | (U//FOUO) Many of the collection and exploitation methods used prior to 1968 continue to be employed in the Intelligence Community. |
|  |  |  |  | Declassifying ELINT material that is 50 years old (and older) would enable adversaries, who do not appreciate how well their signals are currently being exploited by NSA, to ascertain those collection and analysis techniques and subsequently adopt denial practices that could preclude further intelligence exploitation. Such denial would hamper intelligence of the modification of old systems as well as the newest ones. <br> (U) Serious or exceptionally grave damage to national security can be expected if this material were to be declassified, depending on the particular information being revealed. |

| 19. (U//FOUO) A single ELNOT or list of ELNOTs or designators that equate to specific radars, including those from weapons systems, or similar noncommunications signal devices weapons system when associated with amplifying data that identifies the emitter radar, weapon system, country of origin, or ELINT signal acquisition method. | CONFIDENTIAL//REL TO USA, FVEY at a minimum | $\begin{aligned} & 50 \mathrm{X} 1 \\ & 50 \mathrm{X} 3 \end{aligned}$ | *75 years from date of material | (U//FOUO) This category includes information equating a specific ELNOT with a specific radar nickname, such as a NATO nickname, or a radar model number. <br> (U//FOUO) A single ELNOT or list of ELNOTs or designators, e.g., B329A, 1222Z, T6090, 123MZ, when used without amplifying data that identifies the emitter radar, weapon system, or country of origin, or ELINT signal acquisition method is UNCLASSIFIED <br> (C//REL TO USA, FVEY) Examples: <br> - the fact that P307Z and P334A emanate from the Crotale surface-to-air missile is classified CONFIDENTIAL//REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL <br> - the fact that A427B emanates from SLOT BACK <br> radar is |
|  |  |  | CONFIDENTIAL/REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL <br> (U/FOUO) Many of the collection and exploitation methods used prior to 1968 continue to be employed today. Declassifying ELINT material that is 50 years old (and older) would enable adversaries, who do not appreciate how well their signals are currently being exploited by NSA, to ascertain those collection and analysis techniques and subsequently adopt denial practices that could preclude further intelligence exploitation. Such denial would hamper intelligence of the modification of old systems as well as the newest ones. <br> (U) Various levels of harm to national security can be expected if this material were to be declassified, depending on the particular information being revealed. |

| 20. (U/FOUO) FISINT-related material (i.e., information related to collection, processing, and analysis of telemetry and beacons, command uplinks, video data links, tracking, and arming/fusing/command signals as well as reporting based on said data types) | SECRET/REL TO USA, FVEY at a minimum | $\begin{aligned} & 50 \times 1 \\ & 50 \times 3 \end{aligned}$ | *75 years <br> from date of material | (U) Exceptions: <br> - Refer to the following Information Management Instructions (IMIs) for guidance on specific UNCLASSIFIED FISINTrelated information: <br> - DEFSMAC 1M1 <br> (U) <br> - Soviet Deep Space Telemetry Collection 1M1 <br> (U) <br> (U/FOUO) <br> (U/FOUO) FISINT activity began in 1956, and amounts to information that weapons designers use to verify weapon system performance capabilities.

| 25. (U) SIGINT serialized Product Reports that contain cryptalogic information | CONFIDENTIAL//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY at a minimum | $\begin{aligned} & 50 \times 1 \\ & 50 \times 3 \\ & 50 \times 6 \end{aligned}$ | *75 years from date of material | (C/REL TO USA, FVEY) <br> Releasing decrypts allows the target to deduce the strength and range of NSA/CSS's capabilities at that time. When there is direct link between the cryptologies used then and those used today, a straightforward interpolation would allow the target who builds and uses indigenous logics to determine the minimum strength required to defeat NSA/CSS's diagnosis and exploitation today. They can then build and deploy stronger logics or design and deploy logics using different crypto-principles than those used previously. When commercially available logics were used, the target can buy stronger logics or purchase from a different supplier, again with strength and crypto design principles to defeat NSA/CSS's exploitation. When NSA/CSS releases a selected target's decrypts, it has already seen substantive changes in that target's use of cryptography. |

| 26. (U) SIGINT serialized Product Reports consisting of or containing decrypts for the Soviet Bloc or People's Republic of China for the period 1 January 1951 through 31 December 1967 | CONFIDENTIAL//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY at a minimum | $\begin{aligned} & 50 \mathrm{X} 1 \\ & 50 \mathrm{X} 3 \\ & 50 \mathrm{X} 6 \end{aligned}$ | *75 years from date of material | (S//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) SIGINT serialized product reports for the Soviet Bloc or People's Republic of China consisting of or containing decrypts for the period 16 August 1945 through 31 December 1950 are UNCLASSIFIED, as long as all relevant sources- and methods-related metadata has been redacted. <br> (U//FOUO) Relevant sources- and methods-related metadata includes postBRUSA system titles, which did not exist until 1946 and composed a combination of four or more letters and/or numbers.

Alphabet Generator - (U) A cipher machine that generates a multiplicity of cipher alphabets from the interaction of two or more components. Compare to key generatios, below.

BRUSA - (U) The 1946 agreement, now known as UKUSA. In Appendix B (of the 26 February 1946 version) the section on standardization describes the functional system to be used for the nomenclature of foreign cryptographic systems. This common system of nomenclature is now called UKUSA system titles.

Close Access - (S//REL TO USA, FVEY) Refers to the targeting, collection, and/or processing of unintentional emanations from information processing equipment, as well as a program to develop special unique sensors and systems to collect unintentional (compromising) emanations and/or signals from information processing equipment to exploit TEMPEST vulnerabilities. Keywords that could identify close access equities include (but are not limited to)
transducer, radiation, conductance, BOOKLET, magnetic probe, acoustic probe, magnetometer, accelerometer, microphone, transmitted over copper wire, emanations, and unintentional emanations.
