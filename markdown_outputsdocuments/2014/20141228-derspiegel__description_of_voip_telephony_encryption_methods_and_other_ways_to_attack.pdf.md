# VoIP NSA alias 

From GCWiki
Jump to: navigation, search

SAMESHEET is a group for discussing media over packet in the SIGINT community. It initially dealt with just VOIP, but has expanded its scope. These notes get mailed out after each monthly meeting (usually held the third Wednesday of every month.) Look for reminders, calls for Agenda items, and notes on the voip@nsa alias. This alias can be joined at: [1]

This GCHQ record of SAMESHEET meetings is ended in favour of NSA's version at: [2].

I encourage all those who have an interest to join NSA's alias directly.

# Iedit1 IETF San Diego 

(S//CCO) $\square$opened the meeting with a synopsis of the highlights from this past months IETF meeting in San Diego. The IETF has been at the forefront of Internet standards development over the last few decades and is responsible for the SIP standard and future extensions. Of Sigint significance $\square$ passed on a few items such as the Globally Routable User-agent URI (GRUU) which is intended to represent a specific piece of hardware of software instance for selection. Implementations of the GRUU have been slowed due to privacy concerns. Additionally, new session policy extensions may improve our ability to passively target two sided communications by the incorporation of detailed call information being included with XML imbedded in SIP messages. On the security front, SRTP has been slow in the uptake do to key management limitations. At the meeting however there was a significant amount of discussion surrounding Zimmerman's (of PGP fame) ZRTP showing an easier to implement solution. SPEERMINT has been very active as well discussing standards for multi and unilateral peering as well as initial interest in standardization of the Session Border Controller services. Finally, peer-to-peer SIP is heating up which may lead to the formation of a new IETF
working group. This meetings full minutes as well as previous meetings will be posted to

## [edit] IETF SIP, Trip Report

18/09/06 (S//SI) X71's Network convergence project has posted a trip report from July's Internet Engineering Task Force, by . This report describes developments at the IETF in SIP and SIP-related protocols. This report includes observations on SIP-based location conveyance (p. 6 and 10), new media types (p. 11), migration of communication services to SIP (p. 9), plans/issues for
media encryption (p. 12-14), and information on pace of service provider adoption of SIP for presence and instant messaging (p.15-16). Sprinkled throughout are observations on how user identifiers may be changing (p.5,7,8). The executive summary gives thumbnail sketches of each of these.
(U) The report is available on the "trip reports" section of our web site:
