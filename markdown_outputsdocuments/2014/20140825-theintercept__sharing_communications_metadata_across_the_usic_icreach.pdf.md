DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSS Manual 1-52, Dated: 20070108, Declassify On: 20320108
# The Need for Greater IC Sharing of Information 

## 1. (U) Recommendations of 9/11 and WMD Commissions

## 2. (U) Congressional Interest - IRTPA

## 3. (U) DNI - A part of 100-Day Plan

## 4. (U) DoD Information Sharing Strategy
# Information Sharing Policy 

- (U//FOUO) DCID 8/1, June 2004 - "All IC agencies will provide intelligence information at the earliest point at which customers can understand and effectively use it to support their mission objectives..."
- (U//FOUO) NSA Policy 1-9, May 2005 - implements DCID 8/1 and Transformation 2.0: "SIGINT information originated by NSA/CSS shall be shared ... with U.S. Government customers and partners ... and with Foreign Partners... to the maximum extent possible, consistent with applicable statutes, executive orders and regulations, and consistent with the 'need-to-know' principle and with applicable authorities governing the protection of intelligence sources and methods."
# SIGINT Dissemination/Sharing Matrix 

|  | Minimized | Assessed <br> for FI | Shareable |
| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| SIGINT Products \& <br> Services | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| SIGINT <br> Communications <br> Metadata* | Yes | No, but <br> provided for <br> FI purposes | Yes |
| Raw SIGINT | No | No | No |

*(C//REL) Communications metadata refers to structured "data about data": it includes all information associated with, but not including content, and includes any data used by a network, service, or application to facilitate routing or handling of a communication or to render content in the intended format; it includes, but is not limited to; dialing, routing, addressing, or signaling information and data in support of various network management activities (e.g. billing, authentication or tracking of communicants).

# Building on IC Success Information Sharing 

(C//REL) Ensure efficient, effective sharing of ever expanding volumes of IC communications metadata. The IC requires access to a much greater volume of data, for a larger number of analysts.

1. Make more data accessible
2. Wider set of IC Analysts
3. For more comprehensive in-depth analysis of Communications Metadata for

- Situational Awareness
- Collection Management
- Target Development

# NSA'S Proposal 

## PROPOSAL:

1. (U//FOUO) Make IC communications metadata accessible to the greater IC.
a. Data will be updated and accessible instantly by IC Intelligence analysts.
b. Data will be provided for foreign intelligence and counterintelligence purposes.
c. Data sources and methods can be protected.
d. Data will be minimized* according to each agency's standards (e.g. NSA's data will be minimized to NSA minimization standards, CIA's data to CIA minimization standards, etc.).

## * Minimize:

(U/FOUO) specific procedures to minimize the acquisition and retention, and prohibit the dissemination, of nonpublicly available information concerning unconsenting U.S. persons consistent with the need of the U.S. to obtain, produce and disseminate foreign intelligence information.
# NSA'S Proposal 

2. (S) Handles the ever increasing volumes of communications metadata (est. 2-5 billion records/day)
3. (S) Incorporates all communication types - telephony and all forms of digital, e.g. e-mail
4. (U) Allows for the expansion of communications metadata fields and sources
5. (U) Accommodates multimedia (voice/data/video) convergence
6. (U) Allows for greater access by U.S. DoD military elements
7. (U) Requires only JWICS account plus PKI
8. (S//NF) Does not necessarily replace CrissCross/Proton
9. (C) Allows for incorporation of foreign partner data*

* As negotiated
# NSA Proposal Implementation: Use of ICREACH 

(S//REL) ICREACH is a one-stop
![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)
shopping tool for consolidated communications metadata analytic needs. Through ICREACH, analysts can access most tools and all appropriate data sets related to both telephony and DNI data with a single login.
# NSA Proposal Implementation: Use of ICREACH 

## Current Status:

(S//REL) ICREACH is an evolving NSA toolkit (middleware) focused on analyzing the target in a converged telephony-DNI environment. The federated query searches across all data sets for information relating to a target identifier.
(S//SI//REL) For example, through ICREACH an analyst could find all metadata comms related to a target: phone number, Global Mobile Satellite and cellular events and selectors, email address, etc. and any associated locational information.
# ICREACH Implementation 

![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)

1. (U) Certify Users
2. (U) Train Users
3. (U) Grant Access to Users
# ICREACH Certification 

1. (U//FOUO) Who can be certified? Any individual who:
a. requires access in support of Agency $X$ mission (as validated by Agency X POC)
b. is a part of the U.S. IC
c. holds TS/SCI
d. has PKI
e. is an IC-intelligence analyst (of any sort)
2. (U//FOUO) PKI-enabled accounts will be accessible via JWICS.
# ICREACH Training 

(U//FOUO) NSA will train a cadre of individuals from each agency who will then go back and train their own users.
(S//SI//REL) Training consists of:
a. Intro to communications metadata to familiarize users with PSTN*, cell phones, email, IMSIs**, etc.
b. Course to familiarize users with ICREACH tool.
c. Intelligence Oversight training, including minimization.
d. Limitations on use of communications metadata for operational purposes.

* PSTN = Public Switched Telephone Network
** IMSI = International Mobile Subscriber Identity

# ICREACH Access 

1. (U//FOUO) Agency X POCs to approve accounts for individuals.
2. (U) Accounts expire after three (3) months of inactivity.
3. (U) Users re-apply and are re-certified annually.
# Intelligence Oversight 

1. (U//FOUO) Approval authorities and auditors at each agency will conduct the requisite oversight training and then conduct independent oversight.
2. (U//FOUO) Auditing of agency personnel will be conducted by each agency. ICREACH audit records will be pushed by NSA to each agency in order to perform that task.
3. (U//FOUO) Access will be terminated immediately upon identification of any violation and will be reinstated only upon re-certification by the agency approval authority.
4. (U//FOUO) NSA will perform random auditing of IC-wide users to ensure compliance across the IC and notify Agency $X$ of any noncompliance.

# Recap 

- (C//REL) ICREACH is a large scale expansion of communications metadata shared with IC partners
- (C//REL) Enables federation of community metadata across IC agencies
- (C//REL) Makes greater use of NSA's communications metadata which is information about content (but not the content itself)
- Definition: Information used by networks, services, or applications to route communications or make the content usable including:
- Dialing, routing, addressing, location, or signaling data used for network management
- Formats and protocols used to render the information for people and systems
- (S//SI//REL) Expands NSA sharing in three dimensions:
- Includes more modes of communications (PSTN, INMARSAT, PCS, DNI)
- 5x increase in types of metadata shared (from 5 fields to 33 fields)
- 12x increase in volume shared (from 50 billion to 800+ billion records)
