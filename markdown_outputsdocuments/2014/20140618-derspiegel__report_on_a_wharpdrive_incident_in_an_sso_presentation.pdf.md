## (U//FOUO) OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHT WHARPDRIVE

(TS//SI//NF) SSO was informed on 12 March 2013 that the access point for WHARPDRIVE was discovered by commercial consortium personnel. Witting partner personnel have removed the evidence and a plausible cover story was provided. All collection has ceased.
(TS//SI//NF) SSO was planning to conduct a week of training in April and support a deployment in June, however, the partner has requested to delay both training and shipping.
