(S//SI//REL) US, German SIGINTers Increase Cooperation on African Targets
FROM: (S//SI//REL) SIGDEV Analyst, Joint SIGINT Activity (H52G1)
Run Date: 12/13/2007
(S//SI//REL) The ISA* is a joint US-German SIGDEV operation conducted from a German SIGINT facility. It has been filling collection gaps for the US-run European
Security Operations Center's (ESOC) counterterrorism effort, as well as other African missions, for over a year now**. So far in 2007, NSA has produced thirteen Africa-related SIGINT reports from JSA collection, a success which has opened the door to greater cooperation at JSA on the African target set.

(S//SI//REL) ESOC and JSA: A Logical Match

(S//SI//REL) Due to higher priority ongoing tasks for Irag and Afghanistan, ESOC (see background) has had difficulty in getting collection resources to survey for African signals. As a result, ESOC has been investigating possible Third Party relationships to leverage partner accesses and linguistic capabilities. BND is both a trusted partner and a very modern and capable SIGINT service, which lessens concerns about sharing capabilities and SIGINT selectors with this partner as opposed to other potential African partners. JSA's collection resources, as well as BND's overlapping requirements regarding North Africa, made JSA an obvious choice to guickly respond to ESOC's SIGDEV requirements.

(S//SI//REL) JSA Collects Against Africa

(S//SI//REL) In fall of 2006, JSA began collecting email traffic related to GSM infrastructure, producing a number of SIGDEV-related reports. Then in the summer of 2007, ESOC requested that JSA perform a survey of six satellites in search of specific North African communications. During the course of the survey, JSA located and initiated collection on GSM signals carrying communications. In October 2007, ESOC issued its first CT SIGINT report from JSA's GSM (Global System for Mobile communications) collection. In addition to supporting ESOC, JSA is now collecting signahs in support of NSAW's CT mission.

(U) Overlapping Requirements

(S//SI//REL) NSA and BND have similar SIGINT requirements regarding Africa. BND has standing intelligence requirements for various political and humanitarian issues throughout Africa. BND's current priorities in Africa are Sudan, Algeria, and Somalia. In Sudan, BND is collecting two different GSM networks at another FORNSAT facility, and using the metadata to track targets. Germany is very interested in the peace process in Darfur and southern Sudan. Regarding Algeria, BND has been processing border guard communications from JSA collection, but these signals appear to be migrating to a new data network, requiring a new processing capability. BND HQs analysts are eagerly awaiting a processing solution in order to more fully exploit these internal Algerian communications. For Somalia, Germany has forces in the Horn of Africa region supporting Operation Enduring Freedom, and is very interested in the political and humanitarian issues surrounding Somalia.

(U) Future

(S//SI//REL) NSA analysts at JSA are working with CSRC (Collection Strategies and Requirements Center)-Europe and NSA/CSS Representative AFRICOM to explore new areas where JSA can support overlapping African SIGINT requirements from
NSA and BND.
(U) Notes:

* (S//SI//REL) "JSA" stands for "Joint SIGINT Activity." It is operated by NSA and the Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND - German Foreign Intelligence Service) at the German SIGINT facility Mangfall Kaserne in Bavaria. Any association of NSA with Mangfall Kaserne is SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY.
