# (U) Challenge: Integrating Tactical \& National Collection 

- (C//FVEY) Collection with HF/ VHF/UHF
- Digital packets
- Analog comms
- Noise issues, lack of experience with these types of signals
- (C//FVEY) Tactical versus National (Strategic) Collection
![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)
- RTRG
- DISTILLERY
# (U) Analytics for Targets in Europe 

- (C//FVEY) OPSEC Savvy Targets
- "...most terrorists stop thru Europe"
- (TS//FVEY) Use advanced techniques
- Steganography
- Forensics or Analytics on front end
- Encryption
- Takes time and has "black hole" issue
- ( TS//SI//FVEY) Reliance on "special" collection
- GCHQ and FAA
- Problems processing w/r to TS

# (U) Analytics for Identity Intelligence 

| (U) Human <br> Trafficking | (C//FVEY) <br> Operations <br> from Jordan to <br> Syria in both <br> directions; Sahel | Metadata for <br> geolocation; <br> content for <br> confirmation |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| (U) Weapons <br> Smuggling | (C//FVEY) <br> From Libya to <br> Sahel | Metadata for <br> geolocation; <br> content for <br> confirmation |
| (U) Drug <br> Smuggling | (C//FVEY) <br> Sahel and <br> financing of <br> terrorism; <br> Balkans into <br> Europe | Metadata for <br> geolocation; <br> content for <br> confirmation |
| (U) Biometrics <br> \& Elections | (C//FVEY) Used <br> in Africa | Need collection <br> assets |
# (U) Enrichment Sources 

- (U) Air Breather, HF \& UHF/VHF
- (C//FVEY) Big Pipe \& FORNSAT

QRC Package
(U) Military SIGINT Services
(U//FOUO) Forensics
(U) Third Party Sources
(C//FVEY) Second Party

- GCHQ is critical for mission

# (U) Enrichment: SIGDEV \& GCHQ QFDs 

![img-5.jpeg](img-5.jpeg)

- (S//FVEY) 54\% of current ECC DNI tasking based on QFD data
- (S//FVEY) QFDs provide better access to metadata for European \& North African targets than any other access at ECC due to poor passive collection
- ( C//FVEY) Flexibility provided by the use of TDIs and the first stage query allows for better target discovery and development

Slide taken from ECC archives.

## (C//FVEY) Much of ECC data comes from GCHQ QFDs
# (U) Data Flow Integration is Constant Headache 

![img-6.jpeg](img-6.jpeg)
# (U) "Real Time" Analytics 

- (U) Nascent Analytics with unclear definition of "real time"
- How fast is alerting?
- (C//FVEY) DISTILLERY
- Pulled from GHOSTMACHINE stack
- (U) NIAGARAFILES
- File based
- Starting to gain experience
- (C//FVEY) RTRG
- Tools not integrated into ECC
- Data Sets are sparse
- Tactically oriented
- Unregulated alerts can quickly spam user
- (C//FVEY) ECC Current Effort:
- Focused on NTOC and Distributed Denial of Service attack alerting
- Usox DISTILLERV
# (U) Batch: MapReduce Analytics

# (U) Xkeyscore Fingerprints 

![img-8.jpeg](img-8.jpeg)
# (U) Key Take Aways 

- (U//FOUO) Discovery in Africa is based on "we do not know what we do not see"
- Unknown Unknown from url: https://wiki.nsa.ic.gov/ wiki/NTOC-E_discovery_tradecraft
- (U) Europe has Opsec savvy CT targets
- (U) Analytics involve partners
-- 3rd Party in future
- (U) Limited Resources: Processing Power \& BW
