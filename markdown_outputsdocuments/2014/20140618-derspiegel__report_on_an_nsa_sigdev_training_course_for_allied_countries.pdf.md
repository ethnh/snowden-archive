(U//FOUO) First-Ever Formal SIGINT Development (SIGDEV) Training Is Provided to SIGINT Seniors Europe (SSEUR) Partners
FROM: SIGDEV Strategy and Governance, Governance \& Community Engagement (SSG GCE),
Associate Directorate for Education and Training (ADET), and NSA's Foreign Affairs Directorate (FAD)
Run Date: 10/25/2010
(U//FOUO) History has been made: for the first time ever SID, ADET, and FAD personnel collaborated to create an analytic course for NSA Third Party partners. "Introduction to SIGDEV" was held at the European Technical Center (ETC) in Wiesbaden, Germany and taught to 26 students from SSEUR nations,* 14-16 September 2010.
(S//REL) The course provided the SSEUR partners with a common understanding of the importance of SIGINT Development (SIGDEV) as a discipline, and a common definition of SIGDEV efforts. This effort enhanced the opportunities for SSEUR partners to work together more effectively to tackle mission areas of mutual interest -especially Afghanistan and Counterterrorism (CT) target sets.
(U//FOUO) The training was extremely successful, based on survey responses, and many of the partners plan to incorporate information from this course into training programs for their own new SIGINT analysts.
(U//FOUO) SID, ADET, and FAD are currently creating another more in-depth telephony analysis training course with the hopes of presenting this training to NSA Third Party partners in spring/summer 2011.
