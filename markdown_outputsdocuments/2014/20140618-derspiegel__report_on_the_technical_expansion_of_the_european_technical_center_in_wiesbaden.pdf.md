(C//REL) NSA Communications Hub in Europe Is Modernized

(C//REL) Introduction: The European Technical Center (ETC) in Wiesbaden, Germany, is NSA's primary communications hub in that part of the world, providing communications connectivity, SIGINT collection, and data-flow services to NSAers,
warfighters and foreign partners in Europe, Africa and the Middle East. That's why it is essential that ETC's capabilities keep up with the demand...
(C//REL) On 19 September, NSA officials* proudly hosted a ribbon-cutting ceremony to officially mark the completion of GODLIKELESION -- ETC's Communications Center modernization project. The project initially began as a limited effort to address challenges in cooling, equipment configuration, cable management, and space in the room. Over time the effort grew into a much broader joint project to completely rebuild the room from the ground up into a state-of-the-art communications center.

(C//REL) Many years of high operations tempo and expansion had resulted in incorrect rack configurations, poor airflow, insufficient rack size, installation shortcuts, substandard safety and security measures, inconsistent cable management, and lackluster documentation. In early 2010, over 150 power supplies failed over several months, spurring an agreement between NSA's I\&L, Technology Directorate and ETC leadership to expand the scope of the GODLIKELESION project to include a new supporting power infrastructure.
(C//REL) The GODLIKELESION project was completed in seven phases, all without any interruption to the mission data flowing through ETC. Work alternated between Enterprise IT Services (T3) and I\&L elements to replace legacy flooring and equipment racks; close partnering among the organizations allowed for timely completion of the various phased tasks. As an example, all equipment supporting communications for 27 Third Party partner dataflows was moved, re-installed and documented within 12 days.
(U//FOUO) The work completed by I\&L included new Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS), UPS distribution system, grounding system, raised access floor, rack power distribution elements (PDE), and computer room air-conditioner (CRAC) units and
condensation piping. ETC partnered with T32 personnel to remove 81 legacy racks, install 89 new equipment racks, move 253 pieces of equipment, install 5,668 feet of new fiber, and create 1,076 pages of documentation. The new racks represent a $670 \%$ increase in available equipment space with cooling capacity doubled from 2009 conditions. The newly outfitted space will provide reliable and robust IT, communications, and data-transport services for the foreseeable future.
