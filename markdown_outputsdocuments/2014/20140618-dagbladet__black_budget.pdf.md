## (U) Project Description

(U//FOUO) The Foreign Partner Access Project contains two major programs - RAMPART-A and WINDSTOP.
(TS//SI//NF) The RAMPART-A program provides collection against long-haul international leased communications through special access initiatives with world-wide SIGINT partnerships. RAMPART-A employs TURMOIL capabilities, provided by the Net-Centric Capabilities (NCC) Project in the Mission Processing \& Exploitation Expenditure Center. Additional NCC efforts will address the processing challenges of the volume, velocity, and variety of data present at the RAMPART-A sites. RAMPART-A has access to over 3 Terabits per second of data streaming world-wide and encompasses all communication technologies such as voice, fax, telex, modem, e-mail internet chat, Virtual Private Network (VPN), Voice over IP (VoIP), and voice call records.
(TS//SI//NF) The WINDSTOP program focuses on second party relationships. WINDSTOP currently partners with all the second parties, but primarily the United Kingdom (UK), to develop a well-integrated, over-arching architecture to utilize unprecedented access to communications into and out of Europe and the Middle East. Collection capabilities include Digital Network Intelligence processing and selection capabilities for e-mail, web, Internet chat, and VoIP.
(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) This Project supports the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI) by enhancing capabilities that identify emerging threats and vulnerabilities to US communication systems. This Project contains the RAMPART-A Modernization, RAMPART-A Operations and WINDSTOP Sub-Projects.
(U) Base resources in this project are used to:

- (TS//SI//NF) Provide annual upgrades to system capabilities at existing Foreign Partner collection sites to keep pace with the rapidly changing telecommunications field.
- (TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Provide access and collection against international high-priority target

[^0]
[^0]:    - (S//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Support continuing requirements of infrastructure and communications improvements within the Foreign Partner collection sites to collect high speed Digital Network Intelligence, voice, fax, telex, e-mail, internet chat, VPN, and VoIP communications.
- (TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Support CNCI by ensuring that data stores are produced, common collection system analytic techniques are developed, adequate infrastructure is built for increased processing, and enhanced collection tasks in support of cyber defense are implemented to meet the operational needs and satisfy agreements for collection and processing at selected Foreign Partner collection sites using TURMOIL collection systems.
(U) There are no new activities in this Project for FY 2013.
(U) OCO resources in this project are used to:
- (TS//SI//NF) Provide contracted services and equipment for upgrades on a processing suite at a RAMPART-A site. The upgrade will exploit the latest technologies present in networks and consists of the design, procurement, integration, testing and deployment of advanced processing capabilities hosted on the latest server technologies.
(U) The CCP expects this Project to accomplish the following in FY 2013:
- (S//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Expand collection and processing capabilities resulting from joint collaboration efforts and shared access initiatives to leverage the highly lucrative NSA/CSS Second Party access and to exploit high speed Digital Network Intelligence.
- (TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY ) Complete the deployment of NCC Increment 2 and 3 defensive software applications in support of the CNCI interconnected network of sensors.
- (S//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Support and expand the TURMOIL-based foreign site processing systems in order to exploit high-speed Digital Network Intelligence. Support the continuing requirements of infrastructure and communications improvements to RAMPART-A and WINDSTOP that will provide exploitation of high speed Digital Network Intelligence.
- (TS//SI//NF) Integrate Third Party releasable Dialed Number Recognition and Digital Network Intelligence collection systems upgrades, developed by NSA/CSS, within the RAMPART-A site architecture. The new capabilities will enable increased collection of communications available at each RAMPART-A site.
- (TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Upgrade collection capabilities at each site to increase intelligence production.
- (TS//SI//NF) Develop additional access to communications links at each RAMPART-A site. This additional access will increase the amount of international network coverage available for intelligence exploitation.
- (TS//SI//NF) Develop one new Foreign Partner relationship that will enable NSA/CSS to access international communications of high interest for intelligence exploitation.
- (TS//SI//NF) Deploy, operate, or refresh systems to implement key CNCI goals against increasingly complex communication signals at five RAMPART-A sites and two WINDSTOP sites.
(U) Changes From FY 2012 to FY 2013:
(S//NF) WINDSTOP: -\$17.8 million (- $\$ 17.8$ Base). The aggregate decrease is the result of:
- (U) Increases:
- (S//SI//NF) $\$ 1.0$ million to sustain the current level of operations and accesses with its Second-Party partners.
- (S//SI//NF) $\$ 0.9$ million for increased sustainment cost of current operations and Second-Party relationships.
- (S//NF) $\$ 0.1$ million in civilian pay and benefits.
- (U) Decreases:
- (S//SI//NF) \$19.1 million reduces NSA/CSS' ability to deliver shared access opportunities at the scale originally envisioned.
- (TS//SI//NF) $\$ 0.7$ million for deficit reduction and reduces NSA/CSS' ability to expand tasking of new high priority targets $\square$ at 2nd party UK accesses, thus limiting NSA/CSS' flexibility to optimize the current set of tasked signals.
(S//NF) RAMPART - A Modernization: -\$0.5 million (-\$0.5 Base). The aggregate decrease is the result of:
- (U) Increases:
- (S//NF) $\$ 0.1$ million in civilian pay and benefits.
- (U) Decreases:
- (S/SI//NF) $\$ 0.6$ million in equipment purchased for the sustainment of critical RAMPART-A foreign partner sites.
(S//NF) RAMPART - A Operations: -\$0.3 million (-\$4.3 Base, $+\$ 4$ OCO). The aggregate decrease is the result of:
- (U) Increases:
- (TS//SI//NF) $\$ 4.0$ million Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) provides an upgrade to the processing suite at one RAMPART-A's foreign partner site, which will exploit the latest technologies present in networks. This upgrade consists of the design, procurement, integration, testing and deployment of advanced processing capabilities hosted on the latest server technology.
- (S//SI//NF) $\$ 1.3$ million reflects the refreshment of collection equipment at one foreign partner site.
- (S//NF) $\$ 0.3$ million in civilian pay and benefits.
- (U) Decreases:
- (S/SI//NF) $\$ 5.9$ million reflects the planned completion of additional site preparations for the deployment of TURMOIL systems.
