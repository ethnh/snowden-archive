SUBJETY
PURPOSE (TS/\$1/NF) Te obtain SID approval for Cryptanalysis and Exploitation Services (CES) cryptanalysts at the NSA/CSS Cryptologic Centers (CCs) in Texas, Georgia, and Hawaii, who are under direct DIRNSA authority, to access and process NSA SIGINT FISA and CT FBI SIGINT FISA data that is stored in databases in CES at NSAW. This will set a precedent for access to NSA FISA material outside of NSAW.

RACKGROUND: (TS/\$1) As part of CES's strategy for the Extended Enterprise buildout, cryptanalysis efforts at the cryptologic centers in Texas, Georgia, and Hawaii will serve as transparent extensions of the cryptanalysis mission performed by CES in the Office of Target Pursuit's exploitation branches (S31142, S31143, S31131, and S31133) at NSAW. Analysts at the cryptologic centers will become part of a virtual team with NSAW analysts. They will access data that is stored within the CES firewall and will use cryptanalytic procedures and tools, also within the CES firewall, by way of a VPN capability that ensures that security is not compromised and that the data and tools accessed cannot get out to the local network. The priorities of cryptanalytic missions will continue to be set in conjunction with mission elements at NSAW and the Cryptologic Centers as appropriate.

(TS/SS) Cryptanalysis at the cryptologic centers will assess data that is stored in the following databases at NSAW:
FOCRISCORE - fax and DNI data, some of which is NSA or FBI FISA-derived
CAPRICOEN - voice, some of which is NSA or FBI FISA-derived
SOAPOPERA - voice, and product, SRI information, some of which is NSA or FBI FISA-derived
(TS/SS) These databases contain raw data, including uniphrased collection, and, when exploitation is possible, decrypted plain text. Some of the data in the databases is NSA FISA-derived or FBI CT FISA-derived. While not every database contains FISA-derived material, it is reasonable to expect that analysis at the CCs will perform mission with agility, moving across targets and databases as mission demands, and that sometimes that will mean accessing data within a database that does contain FISA-derived data. Access to these databases is restricted to analysis who hold the EAGTIME EC1, have a specific 'used to know' about the data stored within the databases, and who are authorized by the data owner. For some years CES has been the recipient of improperly markedclassified data but all analysts have been and are aware that data marked with the SIGAD US984J and case notation XX.94JP' is FBI FISA data, and that all other data marked with SIGAD US 984* is NSA FISA data. CES believes that the appropriate remedy is to correct the classification of the data before it is fed into our systems. This is an ongoing issue which should not impede the approval of this SFP but the matter should be addressed. CES will ensure that all analysts accessing these databases know that data marked with the SIGAD US984J and case notation XX.94JP' is FBI FISA data, and that all other data marked with SIGAD US 984* is NSA FISA data, and that this data should be classified TOP SECRET/COMENT - EC1 EAGTIME/ NOPORS. Ideally all FISA and non-FISA material should be held separately, and FBI and NSA FISA should be partitioned by individual target. The Office of Overnight and Compliance will work with SS dataflow and Special Source Operations to correct the markingofclassification of data at the front end.
(S/SS) CES at NSAW will work to ensure that all individuals working the cryptanalysis mission at the CCs have the appropriate channones for access to sensitive data, including EAGTIME, and will dictate specific policy and procedural security measures.

REGUUREMENTS: (TS/SS/SF) Following recent meetings and discussions among SID Overnight and Compliance (SV) and NSAW CES, the following are recommendations and requirements that CES and the Cryptologic Centers should agree to implement prior to accessing, handling, processing, retaining, and disseminating NSA FISA and CT FBI FISA-derived collection.
@E requirements: NSA/CSS TX, NSA/CSS GA, and NSA/CSS HI should commit to:
1) (S/SS) The creation of a permanent FISA coordinator position, to be staffed initially by a person experienced with FISA procedures, to ensure compliance with FISA minimization procedures; build a culture and climate of FISA awareness; and facilitate on-site ability to train, field questions, and handle time-sensitive FISA issues.
(S/SS) NSA/CSS TX has identified a permanent FISA coordinator, however that
person has no FISA experience. The CES Mission Manager at TX, who has FISA experience, must perform overnight of CES activities and must participate in the new coordinator's FISA training. SID Overnight \& Compliance will brief both individuals on their responsibilities.

TOP SECRET/COMENT/NOFORN/20291123
(TS/SSI/NF) NSA/CSS GA and NSA/CSS HI have permanent FISA coordinators who have been supporting the Counterterrorism analytic mission. CES must work with those persons to ensure oversight of CES activities. The FISA coordinators will ensure consistent FISA oversight across all Cryptologic Center activities.
2) (S/SSI) The creation of a core FISA workforce which, at all times, contains a stable body of personnel who ideally have at least one year's experience working FISA. A stable, non-transient workforce ensures a well-founded culture for FISA, as has been established at NSAW over many years. Such a culture minimizes the number of FISA-related violations by reinforcing the requirements, restrictions, and sensitivities of accessing and processing FISA.
(S/SI) The CES Mission Managers at Texas, Georgia, and Hawaii have FISA experience and will have supervisory responsibilities over all CES employees at those sites. CES will ensure that all cryptanalysts at Texas, Georgia, and Hawaii will be trained on how to perform the CES mission and on how to handle sensitive materials; all will be knowledgeable about USSID SP0018 and Annex A that describes FISA handling.
3) (S/SI) Provide assurances and documentation that the on-site physical layout of terminals and the means to secure the FISA material is such that access is restricted to only cleared personnel with a need for access to the FISA data.
(S/SI) Seating for individuals performing the cryptanalysis mission will be clustered together to ensure that they have visual and acoustical privacy for technical conversations and to ensure that their conversations and the data displayed on their computer screens is neither accessible nor viewable by those who do not have the appropriate clearances and a "need-to-know". In addition, these individuals will have one or more dedicated printers and combination safes for storage of any authorized FISA material.
4) (S/SI) Provide assurances that FISA material will not be revealed or disseminated as part of site briefings or demonstrations, or in any other format, unless it conforms to and is handled in accordance with FISA Court requirements and minimization procedures approved by the Attorney General, and NSA dissemination policies and procedures. Due to the sensitivity of the sources and methods used to obtain this collection, it cannot be shared with site visitors or other uncleared personnel without proper minimization and attribution to protect those sources and methods.

# OGC requirements: 

(S/SI) Except in exigent circumstances, all personnel that will have access to FISA material should receive initial OGC USSID SP0018 and FBI FISA minimization briefings in person. The briefings given by OGC are interactive in nature and the personal setting gives OGC a better opportunity to interact with all participants. When in person briefings are not possible, briefings will be done via VTC.

RECOMMENDATION: (U) SIGINT DIR concur on access with oversight as described.

## CIIIEE. <br> SID OVERSIGHT \& COMPLLANCE

4 August 2006
TO: (C) SIGINT Director
SUDI: (S) Recommended Requirements for Cryptomlysts at CC's at Tevita, Georgia and Hawaii in acceco NSA and FBI FISA material.
(156/SI) This cupour will set a paradigm as no prior request for accecs to NSA FISA material outside NSAW has been approved. NSA FISA is SIGINT derived from NSA's own submissiess to the US FISA Court. At individual in BID Oversight and Compliance (SV), in a personally cworn declaration to the US FISA Court, assures the Court that all individuals, wherever locaust and in any job (lingua), cryptomlyst, reporter, collector, etc.), who access or use NSA FISA material are trained and will comply with all NSA -obligations attached to this sensitive access.
(156/SI) While SV supports the SACRS build out to the Cryptologic Centers in principle, SV has learned that there are existing deficiencies in classification and handling of NSA FISA and FBI FISA material in CES's database that must be addressed and fixed before additional access at the CCs is approved.
(157/SII) It is vital that both NSA FISA and FBI FISA material be properly and separately identified so that 1) users of that material know that they are assuating NSA FISA or FBI FISA and 2) NSA can remain in compliance with (teparences of Justice and all other obligazsers for FISA handling and misticistration. It is possible that there are already FISA violations resulting from the way data has been stored in these databases and it is critical that these problems be fixed before the problems are spread to new bccaligners.
# TOP SECRET/(COMMIT)20291123 

(TS/SI) For example, the databases FOURSCORE and SAP contain both NSA FISA and FBI FISA that does not carry the appropriate classification (a) NSA and FBI FISA material must carry the "TS/SSI-CCI BGT/NI/FORN/2029123" classification. FBI FISA should also be marked with the OCC approved FBI FISA barcest. Further, NSA FISA and FBI FISA materials are mixed together within the databases, chapter the differences in allowed retention between the two versions of FISA, and both are mixed with non-FISA material. CSS should also provide SV with an SOP clarifying how access (by both CSS and S2 target analysis) to these target folders is maintained, including what chanks are in place to verify user clearances to view NSA FISA and/or FBI FISA material.
(TS/SI) If you support access in principle, I would recommend that no action be taken to establish accounts at the CC's for these CSS databases until SV can ensure that the issues of classification, partitioning and access are restricted and any existing FISA access or retention videlicnus are identified and cleared up.
(TS/SI) Further, SV recommends that this access not be approved until S2/CFS and the Cryptologic Centers involved coordinate with the offices that spenound the NSA FISA court orders and agree to the responsibilities that each will have relative to satisfying the FISA miscarcization procedures (US$10.59B18, Annex A). This is necessary to ensure that all individuals who touch NSA FISA material personally abide by NSA's FISA handling and minimization requirements, ensure that no one makes cormonies assumptions about what another office is doing vis-a-vis meeting these requirements, and ensure that the NSA declarant can swear under such that NSA abides by its obligations.
