# (U//FOUO) On the Road Again: SID Team Visits Germany 

## FROM:

Assistant Deputy Director for Analysis \& Production (S2)
Run Date: 02/01/2006
(U//FOUO) After staying around headquarters for the last guarter, it was time for me to get out and about into the extended enterprise! In early January I joined a SID team on a trip to Germany to gain insight into the operations there and to
update the NSA/CSS Europe workforce on Agency, SID and S2 initiatives. Our team consisted of:

(U/FOUO) We visited elements of the European Command (EUCOM) headquarters and NSA/CSS Europe (NCEUR) near Stuttgart, Germany; the European Security Center (ESC) in Darmstadt; and the European Technical Center (ETC) in Wiesbaden. (See a map of NCEUR locations.) Chief, NCEUR) accompanied us throughout.

# Stuttgart: European Command HQ and NSA/CSS Europe (U//FOUO) 

(U//FOUO) We arrived in Stuttgart on Monday, 9 January. To stave off the jet lag, we walked around downtown Stuttgart until meeting up with a group of NCEUR folks for a dinner of good German food.
(C) On Tuesday morning we were treated to several briefings on EUCOM and NCEUR operations and met with the EUCOM J3 (Director of Operations), Rear Admiral and EUCOM J2 (Director of Intelligence), Brigadier General coming away with a better understanding of their perspectives. We used the opportunity to explain to them how NSA's distributed analytic enterprise can be engaged in efforts to meet their information needs.
(U//FOUO) Our session with the J3 was very positive and he appreciated the value of analysis. Rear Admiral feels strongly that intelligence sharing needs a systematic approach to enable transparency. He recognizes that we are integrated and connected and therefore can't afford to operate independently.
(U//FOUO) We next met with the J2, BG The JAC (EUCOM's Joint Analysis Center in Molesworth, England) joined us virtually, giving us the chance to hear their concerns. We discussed the Mission Build-out, governance, resource challenges and mission management of a distributed enterprise. A key area of concern is "less commonly taught languages" and what we're doing to meet that challenge. We made sure they knew that A\&P is at the forefront by leveraging language resources in Utah (see a related message). the National Virtual Translation Center (NVTC), and our 2nd party partners. We intend to leverage those opportunities enterprise-wide. We also discussed the new "lane structure" and the Strategic Mission List. BG is interested in results from an all-source perspective and asked that we keep our capabilities relevant to EUCOM. He was glad we were there and hoped we would gain an appreciation of their ops during the rest of our visit.
(U//FOUO) We also held a town meeting with NCEUR personnel to cover current events relating to resources and the structure of the Agency, as well as strategic planning initiatives. Major points included:

- Future trends and challenges in A \& P,
- Future roles for the extended enterprise in A \& P
- Changes in IT infrastructure due to new tools and techniques
- S2 Assessment Cell
- Senior Intelligence Authority issues
(U//FOUO) We need to ensure we take advantage of their forward presence. As a forward-deployed function they are empowered leaders and strategists. We need to keep doing forward what's best done forward! Following a busy and productive day we went to a great little restaurant "Waldheim" - or "home in the woods."
(U//FOUO) Patch Barracks, near Stuttgart: home to EUCOM HQ and NCEUR.

Darmstadt: The European Security Center (U//FOUO)
(U//FOUO) On the morning of Wednesday 11 January, we traveled to Darmstadt Army Base to visit with the 66th MI Group and EuramansSorority Center. COL 66th MI GP Commander: LTC ESC Director ESC Deputy Director; and their energetic team provided an outstanding overview of their organizational structure, operations, successes and challenges.
(U//FOUO) The ESC** is a functioning part of the enterprise. They've made great strides in their analytic expertise. The analytic support received from SID/S2/SSG is great and continues to expand. S2 elements, in particular GEO, CT, RT and CP, were lauded for their outstanding support. The ESC, as an A\&P-forward function gives them many advantages. Their state-of-the-art operations area allows them guick, deployable, and operational partnerships. Weekly VTCs with virtual teams for targets relevant to the EUCOM theater help them maintain perspective.

Wiesbaden: The European Technical Center (U//FOUO)
(U//FOUO) We drove on to Wiesbaden that evening. We met up with folks from the ETC for dinner (at a great restaurant - The Winkger (yes, the Vikinger)) to get to know a bit about each other and to help set the stage for Thursday's visit. Through a series of briefings we gained a good perspective on the critical role ETC plays in the enterprise and gained an appreciation of how we can work together to benefit the enterprise. We also held a town meeting with the ETC team where I reiterated what a great job they are doing with customers, partners, and Third Party relationships.

Impressions (U)
(U//FOUO) Throughout the visit, the knowledge and insights our personnel gain by being "forward" in the customer's domain was evident. Even more impressive was how their knowledge of other operations centers, such as NSA HQ, the Cryptologic Centers, SCS, mission ground stations - just to name a few - was being leveraged to respond to the needs of the EUCOM customer. By knowing how the cryptologic system operates, and knowing how to insert requirements, our personnel are able to make significant contributions to the cryptologic enterprise. In addition, they grow professionally and personally - by seeing our Agency from a different perspective, gaining a broader understanding of how we're viewed, and by experiencing life in a different culture.
