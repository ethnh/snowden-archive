# (U) Automation 

- (TS/SI/RE) TURBINEcan talk to active \& passive sensors' shooters
- (TS/SI/RE) Maintenance tasks on routers
- (TS/SI/RE) Dynamic targeting criteria
- (TS/SI/RE) Detect and trigger responses to long polls containing GUIDs
- (TS/SI/RE) Don't wait for the target to read the one precious dorked message
- (TS/SI/RE) Industrial-scale exploitation. Every time the target runs code from the server, why not run TAOS instead?
- (TS/SI/RE) Liberates operators for higher-order tasks
- (TS/SI/RE) If you stole an already-existing PoP, you may not need as much bespoke dev
- (TS/SI/RE) If you're pretending to be the server and never talking through the server (FOX/HUFF), you never play exploits through the provider's sensor net
- (TS/SI/RE) If you define/build an app profile as a TURBINEmission, you can run it across all TAO holdings under TURBINE control
- (TS/SI/RE) Iterative harvesting
