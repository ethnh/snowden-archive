Sorry to bother you with constant emails but did you receive any information on this. We attempted to task some of Sadequee's selectors in CADENCE yesterday but feel short as we did not have the FBI FISA justification. Any help you can provide would be most valueable. Thanks
again.

Mr. $\square$
This is SrA at NSA/CSS Hawaii HS2I2 (Sunni Extremism). I am writing you because I am attempting to retrieve a FISA
justification on Al Qa'ida operative Ehsanul Sadequee. Currently, HS2I2
in conjunction with HS32 (Network Development Department) and NSA are planning on conducting a TAO operation against Sadequee's email addresses. In order to conduct the operation HS2I2 needs the original justification as well as any followups and resubmittals. We were hoping
that you would be able to retrieve this information for us so that we can submit a TAO on this target. Our intent is to begin the TAO before this weekend. Sorry about the short notice but the reason behind our request is that FBI is conducting an operation to apprehend Sadequee sometime this week. Once he is apprehended NSA can no longer conduct a TAO operation against him as the AG2.5 we currently have will be invalid. The reason we are pursing this is because we would like to retrieve a file that was passed between him and an associate about three
weeks ago. The original FISA request was iniated in January 2006 and
will expire in April 2006. We appreciate any help you can provide us. Thanks in advance.
