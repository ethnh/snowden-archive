(TS//SI//NF) S2I12 issued a single source report based on PRISM Skype collection on 10 April 2013 describing U.S.-based Uzbek refugee Fazliddin Kurbanov's discussions with Pakistan-based Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan official Adnan (3/OO/511915-13). Kurbanov expressed desire to attack the US in previous reporting and discussed explosives work. This report described how Kurbanov believed he was under surveillance (which he is by the FBI) but was cautiously continuing his work, which was not specified - could be raising money for the IMU or explosives testing. Adnan wanted Kurbanov to set this work in motion, probably related to sending money back to the IMU. Kurbanov previously promised Adnan that he would raise money in the United States for the IMU.
