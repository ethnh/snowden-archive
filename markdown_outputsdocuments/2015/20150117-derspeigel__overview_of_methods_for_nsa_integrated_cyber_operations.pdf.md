# (S//REL) QUANTUMTREORYMANNTHESISERB'Active Exploitation 

## Concerted Use of both Passive + Active SIGINT

- Implant targets based on 'selectors' and/or behavior
- e.g. users of al-Mehrab ISP (Mosul) who visit al-Hezbah extremist website
- Requires target webserver responses be visible to passive SIGINT
- Requires sufficient delay in target web connection for the hook to "beat" the response back to the target (typically means at least one satellite hop)
- Requires target's client to be vulnerable to our tools
![img-6.jpeg](img-6.jpeg)
- Cycle 0 must get to the target before occurs
- Once 'hooked,' the target is exploited with no time constraints
- Different QUANTUM effects have different time constraints.
