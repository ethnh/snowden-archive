| Experiment | Convergence | 3 | Conv. 17 | Ability to view collected items with reports that have been <br> written from them - MOOHRAKER (assume this would be <br> done using the source record for reports). |
| Refine | Convergence | 3 | Conv. 19 | Be able to launch queries in other SIGINT systems from <br> within EndPoint e.g. Send identified selectors to events tools. |
| Experiment | Convergence | 3 | Conv. 20 | Carbon Rod - show me a man in the middle between this <br> End Point network and this website. (Vulnerability |
