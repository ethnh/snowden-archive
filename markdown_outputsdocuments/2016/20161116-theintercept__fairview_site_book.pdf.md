## INTRODUCTION:

(S//SI) The information provided below provides details on specific security concerns related to the use of the BLARNEY Cover Vehicles. These vehicles are for "Official Use Only" to include the transport of NSA personnel and equipment. These vehicles are solely for the use by personnel who actively support NSA/FBI Programs. These Programs currently include: BLARNEY, FAIRVIEW, STORMBREW and OAKSTAR.

## ACCIDENT AND DAMAGE REPORTING

(S//SI) In the case of an accident, contact the police and request an accident report. Identify yourself as a DoD employee UNLESS reporting your identity could compromise an operation or site, (i.e., involved in an accident while pulling out of a site parking lot). If your address is requested, indicate Ft. Meade, Maryland ONLY. As soon as possible, contact Security, who in turn will contact the General Counsel's Office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
(U) Obtain identities and insurance information of all parties involved and obtain the names of witnesses. Within 24 hours of the accident you must complete Accident form SF91 and submit it to Security.

(S//SI) In the event of an accident that COULD compromise an operation or site, use your personal identification (including your personal insurance information) when requested and notify Security AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. Arrangements will be made, through the FBI, to contact all parties to provide correct and accurate information.

## ACQUISITION AND ASSIGNMENT OF "COVER" VEHICLES

(S//SI) The BLARNEY "cover" vehicles are leased through the Washington Field Office of the FBI in response to our specific vehicle requirements. The lease is through a commercial cover company. However, some personnel are aware of the FBI link but have no knowledge of NSA's involvement. No one should EVER have contact with the leasing company.

## BREAKDOWN (on-road failure)

(U//FOUO) All vehicles should be covered under manufacturer's warranty for major mechanical problems. If necessary, call a tow truck and have it towed to the closest dealer. Failures, such as flat tires, dead battery, should be treated as non-warranty repair and may require the operator to pay out of pocket with
reimbursement provided from BLARNEY's "cash" account as long as a receipt is provided.
(S//SI) When the vehicle is taken to a dealer for repair, use your personal identification but provide your Division Anonymity outside phone number. ETS Division Office:

# CLEANING VEHICLES 

(U) A credit card, provided by the Security Office, should be used when taking the Cover Vehicles to the Car Wash. (See "Credit Cards")

## COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S LICENSES

(U) DoD civilian employees who operate vehicles having a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) or combined GVWR of 26,001 or more pounds on public highways must have a Commercial Driver's License (CDL).

## CONTRACTOR USE OF GOVs

(S//SI) Contractor personnel are prohibited from operating the "Cover" Vehicles.

## COURSE ATTENDANCE

(S//SI) Vehicles may be used to attend Agency-sponsored/off-campus courses if attendance is required in a "cover" capacity. Operations always take priority over any other vehicle use.

## CREDIT CARDS

(S//SI) Security is issued a limited number of cover credit cards for use for vehicle maintenance. The FBI controls these cards and does not want them used in the local area for gasoline purchases. The cards may be used when taking a vehicle TDY or for small repairs (i.e., tires, battery). Always sign your true name to the receipt. Turn the receipt over to the Security Team as soon as possible.

## DISPATCHING ASSIGNED VEHICLES

(U//FOUO) The sign out log for the BLARNEY cover vehicles is located with the keys. You can reserve a vehicle by signing up on the calendar online at "go calendar," choose either BLARNEY Silver or Blue van calendar. Each time a vehicle is taken, you must complete the Sign-Out Log. Operational use of the vehicles takes priority over any/all other requirements. Return the keys and/or vehicle passes to the sign out location.

## DISPOSING OF VEHICLES

(U//FOUO) The Security Team handles the disposition of the vehicles.

## EMISSIONS INSPSECTIONS

(S//SI) The FBI notifies Security when emission inspections are due. Volunteers are solicited from ETS, and funds obtained from the BLARNEY
"cash" account, to get the emissions inspections completed. ALWAYS ENSURE THAT THE PROPER TAGS ARE ON THE VEHICLES BEFORE GOING FOR EMISSIONS TESTING.

# FINES, TRAFFIC VIOLATIONS 

(U) Fines and Traffic Violations are the responsibility of the individual.

## FUEL TYPES

(U) Fuel type should adhere to the guidelines provided by the auto manufacturer.

## IMPAIRED DRIVING

(U) Drivers are responsible to determine and report if he/she is physically incapable of operating an Agency vehicle. Employees may be considered negligent for accidents determined to be caused by their sleepiness, use of medications, alcohol, etc.

## INSURANCE

## KEYS

(U//FOUO) Keys to the BLARNEY vehicles are located with the $2^{\text {nd }}$ floor of the Building in room and in the file cabinet outside the BLARNEY Program Director office Building, room

## LAWS, COMPLIANCE WITH

(U) Operators of any NSA vehicle shall comply with all applicable Federal, State, local laws and no employee may be directed or compelled to disregard these laws.

## MAINTENANCE

(U//FOUO) The BLARNEY Car Custodian is responsible for the routine maintenance of the vehicles, according to the manufacturer's recommendations.

## MEALS AND PERSONAL STOPS

(S//SI) Stops, should they be necessary, shall occur only along the most direct route. In addition, for appearance reasons, stops shall always be avoided within 10 miles of any NSA facility. Vehicle operators shall not schedule their local travel itinerary to include stopping for lunch at the beginning or end of their trip (i.e., early checkout). In addition, NSA vehicles (to include "cover" vehicles) shall NOT be used to transport employees to non-official luncheons (if individuals pay for their own lunch, it's not official). Employees (with the exception of those on TDY who have a need to stop at places required for personal upkeep, comfort or health) shall never use government vehicles to accomplish personal business (e.g., pick up dry cleaning, haircuts, etc).
(S//SI) **EXCEPTION: In keeping with OPSEC purposes (i.e., FBI recommends following an indirect route between NSA and Covert sites), the most direct route may be improper. This is at the discretion of the operator and based on guidelines provided by the FBI or the Security Office.

# OFFICIAL USE OF NSA "COVER" VEHICLES 

(S//SI) The operation of all NSA vehicles is restricted to "official uses" only. Official uses are those which are necessary to accomplish the Agency's mission when operating under a "cover" capacity. Employees are subject to strict penalties when they operate vehicles for other than official uses.
(S//SI) Normally, the answer to what constitutes official use is a matter of management discretion, to be exercised within applicable laws and regulations. Supervisors should ensure that all vehicles under their control are being used solely in direct support of the NSA mission. Before requesting or using NSA vehicles, the following questions must be asked:

1. Is the use of the vehicle for official business and in the best interest to the Government?
2. Have other means of completing the task been ruled out (i.e., telephone, fax, mail)?
3. Is the official business being performed in a "cover" capacity?
(U//FOUO) Personnel using cover vehicles, with business at covert facilities, should avoid direct routes to and from NSA. Good security practices should be employed when determining the route. While there are rules involving overt government vehicles requiring the use of the most direct route between locations, they do no apply to cover vehicles. However, this should not be construed as permitting the use of the vehicle for personal business or other improper activities.
(U//FOUO) Some activities which are not normally considered official use of Government vehicles are: stopping by any employee's home; personal errands; going to pick up food, coffee mess goods, or travel to luncheons; transporting supplies to organizational picnics; and sightseeing. With the exception of parking in conjunction with official business, Agency vehicles should not, as a general rule, stop in NSA employee parking areas (i.e.; to transfer items, retrieve personal goods or coffee mess items).

## OPERATION OF VEHICLES

(U) Agency motor vehicles will be used in such a way as to maximize fuel economy and to extend the life of the vehicle.
# PARKING OR GARAGING OF VEHICLES 

(S//SI) When not in use, the "Cover Vehicles" should be parked outside of When returning the keys remember to indicate the location of where the vehicle is parked.
(U) To minimize the chance of theft or tampering, all vehicles will be secured when parked. This includes shutting off the engine, setting the parking brake, closing all windows, and locking the door.

## PASSES TO ENTER NSA SECURE AREA ENTRANCES

(S//SI) This does NOT refer to parking passes but rather entry to NSA loading dock areas. These passes are maintained by the ETS Division and issued on an as needed basis. It is permissible to take the cover vehicles through the Canine Road Inspection Station for one-day compound passes.

## PENALTIES FOR MISUSE

(U//FOUO) Penalties for unauthorized or willful misuse of an NSA motor vehicle shall be cause for disciplinary actions as follows:

- Civilian Personnel: Any officer or employee of the Government who willfully uses or authorizes the use of any U.S. Government-owned or -leased passenger motor vehicle except for official purposes as authorized by 31 USC 1344 (b), or otherwise violates section 1344 shall be suspended from duty by the Head of the DoD Component concerned, without compensation, for not less than one month and shall be suspended for a longer period or summarily removed from office if circumstances warrant (31 USC 1349(b). Other administrative actions, as warranted by the offense, shall apply if the misuse is determined not be of a willful nature.


## REFUELING GUIDELINES

(U//FOUO) Each vehicle should contain NO LESS THAN one-half tank of gas. It is the responsibility of the driver to ensure that the vehicle is NOT returned with less than $1 / 2$ tank. $\square$ has several gas cards for refueling use that can be signed out and are to be returned with the receipt for gas purchase.

## REPLACEMENT CRITERIA

(U//FOUO) The Security Office coordinates replacement vehicles with the BLARNEY Program Director and the Chief, ETS.

## TAGS (Gov't \& Non-Gov't)

(S//SI) Most cover vehicles keep the tag of the vehicle leasing company. Others have Maryland registration listed to the U.S. Government. Operators should be aware of which tags are on the vehicle they operate.

## TOLL TICKETS

(U//FOUO) EZ Passes are included in the vehicles to cover the cost of tolls.
# TOWING 

(S//SI) If the vehicle needs to be towed, it must be towed to the nearest dealership. Cost of towing will be reimbursed (receipt required).

## (U) Multicultural Awareness:

(S//SI) The FAIRVIEW program has one OCONUS site - SILVER COLLAM (SC). However, Multicultural Awareness is not a big factor in visiting this OCONUS site. When traveling to SC, the SSO employee will travel with a NSA Security representative, a Lithium Security representative, and a Bureau Security representative. The SSO employee should maintain a low profile, decline from venturing off on their own and always follow the guidance of the three program Security representatives.
