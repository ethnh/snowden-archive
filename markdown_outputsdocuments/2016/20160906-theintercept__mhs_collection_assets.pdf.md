## (S//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Two New Collection Assets to Greatly Expand MHS Target Coverage

By: (U//FOUO) $\square$ Menwith Hill Station (F77)
(TS//SI/TK//REL) Menwith Hill Station will accept two new satellites in 2009 - an ORION spacecraft $\qquad$ and a NEMESIS spacecraft $\qquad$ The arrival of these new vehicles will give MHS greater flexibility in missions, surveys, and signals development efforts and provide opportunities for collection, discovery, and sharing. will also provide the Intelligence Community with an opportunity to use Overhead in a nontraditional way for a FORNSAT SIGDEV mission.
(S//TK//REL)
(TS//SI/TK//REL) currently has a launch date of 13 January 2009. After launch, Alice Springs Mission Ground Station will control as it deploys and drifts westward, with MHS gaining control 59 days later.

(S//TK//REL) MHS will perform testing and verification before putting the spacecraft into full operations. If the current launch date stands, will be fully operational sometime around mid May 2009. (Click HERE for larger image.)
(TS//SI/TK//REL) $\square$ s initial mission is a survey of the People's Republic of China (PRC) line-of-sight microwave towers and emitters will survey the area drifting from east for approximately 30-45 days. At east, will pick up its new primary mission from Thuraya collection and Afghanistan/Pakistan exfiltration.
(TS//SI/TK//REL) After spacecraft transfers the Thuraya mission to $\square$ will drift 0.1 degree a day west, continuing the PRC survey for approximately 200 more days. After completion of the PRC survey, will take on a new mission targeting Latin America, Middle East and North Africa, greatly expanding MHS's target and coverage area.
