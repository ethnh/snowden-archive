# ASPHALT : "Collect-it-all" 

"Why Can't We Collect All The Signals, All The Time? Sounds like a good summer homework project for Menwith!" - LTG Keith Alexander talking about FORNSAT during a 16 June 2008 visit to MHS

## ASPHALT Approach / Principles

- Focus on the middle 90\%
- Attack the Bottlenecks
- Stress Scalability
- Experience to inform
- Minimize Complexity
- Strong Use of Standards
- Loosely Coupled Components
![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)
- Simplified Deployments, Maintenance, and Operations


## - Open, Service Oriented Architecture

- "Best of Breed" component selection
- Heterogeneous components
- Packetized Signal Distribution
- Near lossless \& distortion free distribution
- Enables a "data center" based solution
# BLACKTOP : "Survey it all" 

Today: MHS Surveys 1K signals each month
Goal: Survey $\sim 9 \mathrm{~K}^{*}$ signals every 2 weeks by Nov. 2010

## The Plan:

- Partner with existing tool providers to build a better survey suite
- DARKQUEST (NSA)
- SHAREDVISION / QUEST
EVIL EYE (GCHQ)
ROADBED
- Add new capabilities to enhance corporate tools
- Improve TDMA Detection
- Incorporate new algorithms (e.g. Best guess demodulator)
- Do more than just demodulate
- Understand the target in context
- Use survey to automatically drive sustained collection


## Know our environment!

* There are approximately 9000 signals in the viewable arc at MHS, so this equates to all signals in our environment.

# TARMAC: "Process-it-all" 

## ASPHALT, NOSEYPARKER, Torus antenna \& new missions

will produce more data than ever.

## How can we scale up our access processing?

TARMAC is a Study to use Special Source Access Techniques in the FORNSAT / OH Realm:

- Supports GCHQ's OneIP Initiative
- $\quad$ Produces Single Line Records (SLRs) from MHS IP collection
- SLRs are sent to BLACKHOLE event database at GCHQ
- Query Focused Datasets (QFDs) are derived from this data to support analytic efforts

It's all about the metadata!
$\approx 6,000,000$ events / day

# GTE at MHS : "Exploit it All" 

![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)

- Develop pioneering collection capability across the SIGINT community
- Established at MHS April 2010
- Increase value of MHS access
- DNR data from NOSEYPARKER \& Specials forwarded to Knowledge Bases
- 175 MHS DNI links surveyed / day
- Protocol exploitation \& development
- Internet Application Protocol analysis
- 80+ XKEYSCORE Signatures
- Personal security products
- Mobile internet applications
# Access - Challenges 

![img-5.jpeg](img-5.jpeg)

- Automatic promotion of data based on broad tasking authority
- If we can promote internally, why not across access?
- Need visibility of other accesses - does that include health and wealth?

## Questions?

## THE SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA. FVEY
# What's Next for ASPHALT? 

## BASSQUEST Tech Transfer

- NSA FORNSAT "Access-it-all" Architecture
- Radio service based on ASPHALT principles
- Yakima is the first scheduled deployment


## Keep Improving the Prototype

- Add more demodulators
- R4 GNU Software radio
- GRANDPIANO (Generic TDMA Architecture)
- Demonstrate cross-access support
- NOSEY PARKER
- Overhead
- Incorporate Geolocation Techniques
- DIRNSA's VSAT Geolocation Task
- Coarse OH / FORNSAT Geolocation (FOGHORN)
- APPARITION Collaboration
