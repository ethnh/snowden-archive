# E. MILKWHITE Enrichment Service (MES) Programme 

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

In FY11/12 the MES Programme will continue to support the Home Office Communications Capabilities Directorate (CCD), whose programme is tasked with modernising the UK's domestic interception capabilities. The CCD SR10 settlement includes funding to sustain CCD mitigation projects that deliver early benefits during years 1-2 of the funding period. MES sustainment is one key component of this portfolio:

- External funding deferred from 2010/11 will enable GCHQ to deliver advanced analytics, mobile convergence and to scale the MES Advanced Service
- External sustainment funding will enable GCHQ to deliver post and continuing design services (PDS/CDS); to maintain the MES-funded access and bulk events storage; and to tailor the advanced analytics capability to keep pace with short term changes in the communications environment.
GCHQ's separate SR10 sustainment settlement does not contain parallel funding to sustain MES access and processing.


## Customer Diversity (collaborative working)

The MES Standard Service has been TTO'd to the five intercepting law enforcement agencies ${ }^{2}$ via the SOCA-hosted, multi-agency Internet Data Unit (iDU) and to BSS via the A8 Digint Identification Team (DIT). SOCA and HMRC also receive the MES Advanced Service via established 'business as usual' channels. During 2011/12 the standard service will be extended to SIS and the advanced service will be tailored to meet BSS and SIS requirements.

## Service Capacity

During 2011/12, service capacity will grow to keep pace with increasing customer demand, up to the agreed service level agreements for each agency. The BSS Standard and SOCA/HMRC Advanced services are expected to have reached their planned capacity by $31^{\text {st }}$ March 2011 and this will be sustained through SR10. As new services are established their capacity will be grown to match planned SLA's in line with actual customer demand.

# Service Productivity 

GCHQ will continue to monitor the productivity per request (\% of identifiers enriched and diversity of enrichment) to ensure that the underlying analytic capabilities and tools keep pace with the changing communications environment.

## Enabling Business Change

Rapid changes in technology and target communications behaviours are driving our customers to adopt new ways of working with Internet data. Implementing these new services is enabling the community to identify and overcome many of the operational, cultural and policy challenges associated with this transformation, and GCHQ will continue to be forward leaning in supporting the CCD change agenda.
