# MIS Metrics Pack 

- Recent Event: London G20 Event
- Study of Preston Collection and use over last 6 months
- CPC, RPC, Metrics
- INA Transformation
# Highlights 

- London G20 Event- In contrast to other recent events (e.g Mumbai) most of the useful collection on this event came from 'traditional' sources - mainly Preston
- Preston Study- Nonetheless a very small proportion of Preston traffic is normally viewed. This may be of concern as this traffic is warranted.
- CPC, RPC- traffic collection increasing steadily and all IPTs profiting
- INA Transformation- INA collection,viewing and EPR increasing

- Whilst Preston collection made up the bulk of the reporting on G20, it is clear from the above figures that only a small proportion of the Preston Traffic is viewed. This is of concern as the collection is all warranted. However note caveat below:
- Viewing figures from some repositories including Xkeyscore/Salamanca and Haustorium are not included in these statistics as currently Artemis does not receive a feed from them. Full events feeds should be available by $2^{\text {nd }} \mathrm{Q}$ next year.
# PRESTON collection by sigad

- Only 3\% of PRESTON collection over the last 6 months was viewed.- As noted in previous slide,viewing figures from events repositories are not available
- Collection info is only available for ZAMENSIS, REMEDY, GERONTIC, CATSUP and CONDONE. The other sources relate to billing data and as noted Artemis does not yet have a feed from events data bases.
- It is interesting to note that some of these accesses (UKC123A-Laboro and UKC126-Larkspur) were lost between a year and 2 years ago but historical data in repositories is clearly still proving useful.
