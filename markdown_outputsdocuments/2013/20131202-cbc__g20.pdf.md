(S//REL) NSA Lends Support to Upcoming G8 and G20 Summits in Canada FROM
Strategic Intelligence Issues (S17)
Run Date: 06/23/2010
(S//REL) President Obama will travel to Canada to participate in the G8 and G20 Summits
from 25 to 27 June. NSA is actively assisting executive protection and event security, and providing support to policymakers.

Background (U)
(U) As host, Canada has set this G8 Summit's theme: Recovery and New Beghning. On the G8 agenda are international development (health, food security, natural resources trade, and climate change); and peace and security (nonproliferation and Afghanistan-Pakistan).
(U) The G20 Summit is to focus on implementing the September 2009 Pittsburgh G20 Summit's framework for strong and balanced world economic growth. Also on the agenda are international financial institutions' reform and re-financing, financial sector regulatory reform, and countering trade protectionism.

# Summit Venues (U) 

(U) The G8 Summit will be held on 25 and 26 June in Huntsville, in Ontario's Muskoka Region. (The G8 Summit venue is also called Muskoka.) The G20 Summit will be held on 26 and 27 June in Toronto, Ontario -- about 140 miles south of Huntsville. A preparatory meeting among G20 sherpas (aides and personal representatives of the heads of state and government) is set for 23 and 24 June in Toronto.

## Threat Potential (U)

(S//REL) The Intelligence Community assesses that there is no specific, credible information that al-Qa'ida or other Islamic extremists are targeting the G8 and G20 Summits. Al-Qa'ida and associated groups, however, have expressed interest in targeting Canada in the past, and the Summits may provide an attractive target for terrorists seeking to capitalize on the media coverage.
(S//REL) The Community judges, however, that issue-based extremists pose a more likely threat to the Summits. These extremists have conducted acts of vandalism at previous G8 and G20 summits. Similar disruptive activity will probably occur throughout the Summits, and will be more concentrated during the G20 in Toronto.

## G8 and G20 Summit Participants (U)

(U) The G8 -- the Group of Eight -- is both the forum of eight industrialized nations and the annual meeting of the heads of state or government of these eight nations: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, United Kingdom, and the United States. For the Huntsville G8 Summit, Canada has invited the leaders of Algeria, Egypt, Ethiopia, Malawi, Nigeria, Senegal, and South Africa to participate in an Africa outreach session. Also invited are Colombia, Haiti, and Jamaica.
(U) The G20 -- the Group of Twenty -- consists of the G8 members plus: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, China, European Union, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, and Turkey. Also invited to attend the Toronto G20 Summit are: Ethiopia, Malawi, Netherlands, Nigeria, Spain, and Vietnam, plus the Financial Stability Board, the International Monetary Fund, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, the United Nations and its International Labour Organization, the World Bank Group, and the World Trade Organization. (The next G20 Summit will be held during November 2010 in Seoul, South Korea.)

# Intelligence Community Support Structure (U) 

(S//REL) The Director of National Intelligence Representative (DNIR) in Ottawa is the United States Government (USG) intelligence lead for the G8 and G20 Summits. The DNI's Special Events Intelligence Coordinator (SEIC) will operate a Threat Integration Center (TIC) in the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa to support him during both events. The TIC began normal operations on 22 June, and will operate 0600 to 2100 EDT from 24 through 27 June. The TIC will publish a twice daily Situation Report, respond to Requests for Information and coordinate the dissemination of intelligence and pre-event assessments.

## NSA Support to Event Security (U)

(S//REL) Relevant SID reporting offices are aware of the Summits and poised to report in a timely matter intelligence related to the events. While NSA will have no physical presence in the TIC, direct coordination will be through the CTMMC and NSOC, who will further collaborate with the Special U.S. Liaison Office, Ottawa (SUSLOO) staff and provide threat warning directly to the venues. NSA support planning has been closely coordinated with the Canadian partner through SUSLOO.
(S//SI//REL) NSA support to both events may include, but is not limited to: executive protection U.S. policy goals, situational awareness, threat information, and local security posture. Reporting instructions have been published by S12 in "SIGINT Reporting in Support of the G8 and G20 Summits, Canada, June 2010" (ISS-148-10). A SIGINT collaborative workspace has been established for the G8 and G20 Summits on Extended Shared Enterprise Corporate Server (ESECS). See "CASE-2010-99: (U//FOUO) G8 and G20 Summits in Canada, 25-27 June." A WikiInfo page G8-G20 Canada 2010 has been created for the Summits, and additional information may be found at the S17 Economics and Global Issues G8/G20 website.
(S//REL) CTMMC will be the focal point for 24/7 CT operations, employing normal procedures to ensure timely and effective distribution of threat tippers and lead information, to coordinate CT activities related to any threat situation, and to facilitate foreign release requests.
(C//REL) S111's SCC desk will be responsible for coordinating RFIs and responses, while NSOC/CRSMM will respond to time critical RFIs after hours. NSOC/CRSMM will also coordinate drafts of the TIC's twice-daily sitreps.
(C/REL) NSOC/APSMM will provide reachback to TOPIs and extended enterprise for policy support issues using normal call-in procedures and instructions.
(S/REL) NSOC/SRO will facilitate after-hour requests for release of non-threat information, while S12's Partnership Dissemination Cell (PDC) will perform this function during normal duty hours.
(S//REL) NSA's Event lead, S17 Strategic Intelligence Issues, will work extended hours, approximately 0600 to 2200 EDT through 27 June to maintain situational awareness of SIGINT capabilities and facilitate coordination across the SIGINT system and with the IC.
(S//REL) SUSLOO personnel will be available for call-in by CTMMC, NSOC or S17 to provide local support to the TIC for imminent threat situations.
