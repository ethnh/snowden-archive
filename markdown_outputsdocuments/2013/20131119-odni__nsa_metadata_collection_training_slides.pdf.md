## Lesson 1 - Introduction to the Business Records (BR) FISA

Lesson 1 Slide 7 "Legal Disclaimer"

## Legal Disclaimer

This course:
IS NOT designed to take the place of:
Homeland Mission Coordinator (HMC)
Office of Oversight \& Compliance (SV)
Office of General Counsel (OGC)

## Remewed approximately every 60-90 days

Contact your local HMC, SV, or OGC for case-specific guidance

## (U//P@UG) This course is not

designed to take the place of specific guidance from a Homeland Mission Coordinator (HMC), the Office of Oversight \& Compliance (SV), or from the Office of General Counsel (OGC). The course is designed to enhance your understanding of how to comply with the BR FISC Order and to understand the RAS standards used in concert with BR FISA.
(U//P@UG) Because, the BR FISC Order is renewed approximately every 60-90 days, the FISC may change the authority or place new restrictions in a new FISC Order. It is important to understand that unique operational circumstances may result in a change in guidance from this course. Therefore, if you experience any uncertainty (delete) it is always sound advice to contact your local HMC, SV, or OGC for case-specific guidance.

## Summary

You should now be able to

- Identify the purpose of the BR FISA Order
- Recognize the $\square$ groups covered by the BR FISA Order
- Define terms relevant to the BR FISA Order: telephony metadata, telephony identifier, hops, and Seed
(TS/SS/NF) You have now completed the lesson that discusses the BR FISA authority.
(TS/SS/NF) You should now be able to:

## Summary of RAS Standard

## BR FISC Order

Government may request to use specific identifiers to query the metadata for purposes of obtaining foreign intelligence through contact chaining or

- telephone numbers

"Reasonable Articulable Suspicion standard"
(FS/SW/NF) You will recall from Lesson One that the BR FISA Order is authorized because the FISC recognizes there is a counterterrorism interest in obtaining those business records. However, because NSA is receiving a great deal of US person telephony records, we have strict guidelines on when NSA can access the metadata under this authority. One of the requirements is that in order to access the metadata, NSA must establish RAS on each selector prior to querying the BR FISA repositories.
(TS/SW/NF) The BR FISC Order states that NSA may quegespecific identifiers
that satisfy the RAS standard for purposes of obtaining counterterrorism intelligence.
(TS/SW/NF) In order to assist in determining when a selector has satisfied the RAS standard, the Office of General Counsel (OGC) has issued a RAS Memo to help Signals Intelligence Directorate (SID) personnel make RAS determinations on telephone identifiers. The memo contains guidelines that apply to both the BR and Pen Register and Trap and Trace (PR/TT) FISA Orders.

- SIGINT reports
- Investigations by the CIA or FBI
- FISA surveillance data derived from other authorized targets
- SIGDEV work tied to published information
- Other transcripts

Lesson 4 Slide 1 "Lesson Objectives"

In this lesson we will examine a Business Records (BR) FISA Court (FISC) Order.

At the conclusion of this lesson you will be able to:

- Identify BR FISC Orders as NSA's authorization to collect telephony metadata from specified US telecommunication companies in order to protect against international terrorism

# Lesson Objectives 

In this lesson we will continue to examine the Business Records (BR) FISA Court (FISC) Order. At the conclusion of this lesson you will be able to:

- Distinguish between analysts authorized to query BR FISA metadata and individuals authorized to receive results of those queries
- Identify further limitations on accessing, sharing, disseminating, and retaining BR FISA metadata
- (TS/ST/NF) In this lesson we will continue to examine the Business Records (BR) FISA Court (FISC) Order. At the conclusion of this lesson you will be able to:
- Distinguish between analysts authorized to query BR FISA metadata and individuals authorized to receive results of those queries
- Identify further limitations on accessing, sharing, disseminating, and retaining BR FISA metadata
![img-28.jpeg](img-28.jpeg)
(TS/ST/NF) The Director of NSA (DIRNSA) strictly controls access to and use of raw BR metadata.

(TS/ST/NF) Query access to BR raw metadata is limited to individuals trained and designated as BR FISA Query Analysts. This is the only group permitted to query raw BR FISA metadata for contact chaining and purposes. The BR FISA Order limits the number of individuals who can be named in this category as well as how many can be designated as Homeland Mission Coordinators. There are several other categories of people who are authorized to access the raw metadata such as technical individuals and Data Integrity BR FISA Analysts; those who access the repository for the purpose of ensuring that the data is compliant.
(TS/ST/NF) The BR metadata is authorized to be stored in two NSA repositories-1

B
Authorized Query Analysts are permitted to query BR raw metadata within 1 to receive query results.
# Oversight for Access Restrictions 

Oversight for Access Restrictions
![img-29.jpeg](img-29.jpeg)

BR Court order requires logging for auditing purposes:

- Query requests
- User login
- IP address
- Date and time of the access
(U/PodO) This is very important so we'll reiterate it with more detail.
(TS/Sti/NF) Signals Intelligence Directorate's Office of Oversight and Compliance has implemented a series of auditing controls designed to limit access to the BR FISA metadata only to those who have been briefed by the OGC and those who have completed all of the required training.
(TS/Sti/NF) When the raw metadata is accessed in order to perform a query, an automatic audit log is recorded that includes:
- Query request
- User login
- Internet protocol address
- Date and time of the access
