# PREAMBLE 

Timely, accurate, and insightful information about the activities, capabilities, plans, and intentions of foreign powers, organizations, and persons, and their agents, is essential to the national security of the United States. All reasonable and lawful means must be used to ensure that the United States will receive the best intelligence possible. For that purpose, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the National Security Act of 1947, as amended, (Act) and as President of the United States of America, in order to provide for the effective conduct of United States intelligence activities and the protection of constitutional rights, it is hereby ordered as follows:

PART 2 Conduct of Intelligence Activities
2.1 Need. Timely, accurate, and insightful information about the activities, capabilities, plans, and intentions of foreign powers, organizations, and persons, and their agents, is essential to informed decisionmaking in the areas of national security, national defense, and foreign relations. Collection of such information is a priority objective and will be pursued in a vigorous, innovative, and responsible manner that is consistent with the Constitution and applicable law and respectful of the principles upon which the United States was founded.
2.2 Purpose. This Order is intended to enhance human and technical collection techniques, especially those undertaken abroad, and the acquisition of significant foreign intelligence, as well as the detection and countering of international terrorist activities, the spread of weapons of mass destruction,
and espionage conducted by foreign powers. Set forth below are certain general principles that, in addition to and consistent with applicable laws, are intended to achieve the proper balance between the acquisition of essential information and protection of individual interests. Nothing in this Order shall be construed to apply to or interfere with any authorized civil or criminal law enforcement responsibility of any department or agency.
2.3 Collection of information. Elements of the Intelligence Community are authorized to collect, retain, or disseminate information concerning United States persons only in accordance with procedures established by the head of the Intelligence Community element concerned or by the head of a department containing such element and approved by the Attorney General, consistent with the authorities provided by Part 1 of this Order, after consultation with the Director. Those procedures shall permit collection, retention, and dissemination of the following types of information:
(a) Information that is publicly available or collected with the consent of the person concerned;
(b) Information constituting foreign intelligence or counterintelligence, including such information concerning corporations or other commercial organizations. Collection within the United States of foreign intelligence not otherwise obtainable shall be undertaken by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) or, when significant foreign intelligence is sought, by other authorized elements of the Intelligence Community, provided that no foreign intelligence collection by such elements may be undertaken for the purpose of acquiring information concerning the domestic activities of United States persons;
(c) Information obtained in the course of a lawful foreign
intelligence, counterintelligence, international drug or international terrorism investigation;
(d) Information needed to protect the safety of any persons or organizations, including those who are targets, victims, or hostages of international terrorist organizations;
(e) Information needed to protect foreign intelligence or counterintelligence sources, methods, and activities from unauthorized disclosure. Collection within the United States shall be undertaken by the FBI except that other elements of the Intelligence Community may also collect such information concerning present or former employees, present or former intelligence element contractors or their present or former employees, or applicants for such employment or contracting;
(f) Information concerning persons who are reasonably believed to be potential sources or contacts for the purpose of determining their suitability or credibility;
(g) Information arising out of a lawful personnel, physical, or communications security investigation;
(h) Information acquired by overhead reconnaissance not directed at specific United States persons;
(i) Incidentally obtained information that may indicate involvement in activities that may violate Federal, state, local, or foreign laws; and
(j) Information necessary for administrative purposes. In addition, elements of the Intelligence Community may disseminate information to each appropriate element within the Intelligence Community for purposes of allowing the recipient element to determine whether the information is relevant to its responsibilities and can be retained by it, except that information derived from signals intelligence may only be disseminated or made available to Intelligence Community elements in accordance with procedures established by the
Director in coordination with the Secretary of Defense and approved by the Attorney General.
2.4 Collection Techniques. Elements of the Intelligence Community shall use the least intrusive collection techniques feasible within the United States or directed against United States persons abroad. Elements of the Intelligence Community are not authorized to use such techniques as electronic surveillance, unconsented physical searches, mail surveillance, physical surveillance, or monitoring devices unless they are in accordance with procedures established by the head of the Intelligence Community element concerned or the head of a department containing such element and approved by the Attorney General, after consultation with the Director. Such procedures shall protect constitutional and other legal rights and limit use of such information to lawful governmental purposes. These procedures shall not authorize:
(a) The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to engage in electronic surveillance within the United States except for the purpose of training, testing, or conducting countermeasures to hostile electronic surveillance;
(b) Unconsented physical searches in the United States by elements of the Intelligence Community other than the FBI, except for:
(1) Searches by counterintelligence elements of the military services directed against military personnel within the United States or abroad for intelligence purposes, when authorized by a military commander empowered to approve physical searches for law enforcement purposes, based upon a finding of probable cause to believe that such persons are acting as agents of foreign powers; and
(2) Searches by CIA of personal property of nonUnited States persons lawfully in its possession;
(c) Physical surveillance of a United States person in the United States by elements of the Intelligence Community other than the FBI, except for:
(1) Physical surveillance of present or former employees, present or former intelligence element contractors or their present or former employees, or applicants for any such employment or contracting; and
(2) Physical surveillance of a military person employed by a non-intelligence element of a military service; and
(d) Physical surveillance of a United States person abroad to collect foreign intelligence, except to obtain significant information that cannot reasonably be acquired by other means. 2.5 Attorney General Approval. The Attorney General hereby is delegated the power to approve the use for intelligence purposes, within the United States or against a United States person abroad, of any technique for which a warrant would be required if undertaken for law enforcement purposes, provided that such techniques shall not be undertaken unless the Attorney General has determined in each case that there is probable cause to believe that the technique is directed against a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power. The authority delegated pursuant to this paragraph, including the authority to approve the use of electronic surveillance as defined in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, as amended, shall be exercised in accordance with that Act.
2.6 Assistance to Law Enforcement and other Civil Authorities. Elements of the Intelligence Community are authorized to:
(a) Cooperate with appropriate law enforcement agencies for the purpose of protecting the employees, information, property, and facilities of any element of the Intelligence Community;
(b) Unless otherwise precluded by law or this Order,
participate in law enforcement activities to investigate or prevent clandestine intelligence activities by foreign powers, or international terrorist or narcotics activities;

2.8 Consistency With Other Laws. Nothing in this Order shall be construed to authorize any activity in violation of the Constitution or statutes of the United States.
2.9 Undisclosed Participation in Organizations Within the United States. No one acting on behalf of elements of the Intelligence Community may join or otherwise participate in any organization in the United States on behalf of any element of the Intelligence Community without disclosing such person's intelligence affiliation to appropriate officials of the organization, except in accordance with procedures established by the head of the Intelligence Community element concerned or the head of a department containing such element and approved by
the Attorney General, after consultation with the Director. Such participation shall be authorized only if it is essential to achieving lawful purposes as determined by the Intelligence Community element head or designee. No such participation may be undertaken for the purpose of influencing the activity of the organization or its members except in cases where:
(a) The participation is undertaken on behalf of the FBI in the course of a lawful investigation; or
(b) The organization concerned is composed primarily of individuals who are not United States persons and is reasonably believed to be acting on behalf of a foreign power.
2.10 Human Experimentation.

# C5. CHAPTER 5 

## PROCEDURE 5. ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE

## C5.1. PART 1: ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE IN THE UNITED STATES FOR INTELLIGENCE PURPOSES

C5.1.1. Applicability. This part of Procedure 5 implements the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1979 (reference (b)), and applies to electronic surveillance, as defined in that Act, conducted by DoD intelligence components within the United States to collect "foreign intelligence information," as defined in that Act.

## C5.1.2. General Rules

C5.1.2.1. Electronic Surveillance Pursuant to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. A DoD intelligence component may conduct electronic surveillance within the United States for foreign intelligence and counterintelligence purposes only pursuant to an order issued by a judge of the court appointed pursuant to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (reference (b)), or pursuant to a certification of the Attorney General issued under the authority of Section 102(a) of the Act.

C5.1.2.2. Authority to Request Electronic Surveillance. Authority to approve the submission of applications or requests for electronic surveillance under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (reference (b)) shall be limited to the Secretary of Defense, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, the Secretary or Under Secretary of a Military Department, and the Director of the National Security Agency. Applications for court orders will be made through the Attorney General after prior clearance by the General Counsel, DoD. Requests for Attorney General certification shall be made only after prior clearance by the General Counsel, DoD.

## C5.1.2.3. Electronic Surveillance In Emergency Situations

C5.1.2.3.1. A DoD intelligence component may conduct electronic surveillance within the United States in emergency situations under an approval from the Attorney General in accordance with Section 105(e) of reference (b).

C5.1.2.3.2. The head of a DoD intelligence component may request that the DoD General Counsel seek such authority directly from the Attorney General in an emergency, if it is not feasible to submit such request through an official designated in subparagraph C5.1.2.2., above, provided the appropriate official concerned shall be advised of such requests as soon as possible thereafter.
# C5.2. PART2: ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES FOR INTELLIGENCE PURPOSES 

C5.2.1. Applicability. This part of Procedure 5 applies to electronic surveillance, as defined in the Definitions Section, for foreign intelligence and counterintelligence purposes directed against United States persons who are outside the United States, and who, under the circumstances, have a reasonable expectation of privacy. It is intended to be applied in conjunction with the regulation of electronic surveillance "within the United States" under Part 1 and the regulation of "signals intelligence activities" under Part 3 so that the intentional interception for foreign intelligence and counterintelligence purposes of all wire or radio communications of persons within the United States and against United States persons abroad where such persons enjoy a reasonable expectation of privacy is covered by one of the three parts. In addition, this part governs the use of electronic, mechanical, or other surveillance devices for foreign intelligence and counterintelligence purposes against a United States person abroad in circumstances where such person has a reasonable expectation of privacy. This part does not apply to the electronic surveillance of communications of other than United States persons abroad or the interception of the communications of United States persons abroad that do not constitute electronic surveillance.

## C5.2.2. Explanation of Undefined Terms

C5.2.2.1. Electronic surveillance is "directed against a United States person" when the surveillance is intentionally targeted against or designed to intercept the communications of that person. Electronic surveillance directed against persons who are not United States persons that results in the incidental acquisition of the communications of a United States person does not thereby become electronic surveillance directed against a United States person.

C5.2.2.2. Electronic surveillance is "outside the United States" if the person against whom the electronic surveillance is directed is physically outside the United States, regardless of the location at which surveillance is conducted. For example, the interception of communications that originate and terminate outside the United States can be conducted from within the United States and still fall under this part rather than Part 1.

C5.2.3. Procedures. Except as provided in paragraph C5.2.5., below, DoD intelligence components may conduct electronic surveillance against a United States person who is outside the United States for foreign intelligence and counterintelligence purposes only if the surveillance is approved by the Attorney General. Requests for
approval will be forwarded to the Attorney General by an official designated in subparagraph C5.2.5.1., below. Each request shall include:

C5.2.3.1. An identification or description of the target.
C5.2.3.2. A statement of the facts supporting a finding that:
C5.2.3.2.1. There is probable cause to believe the target of the electronic surveillance is one of the following:

C5.2.3.2.1.1. A person who, for or on behalf of a foreign power is engaged in clandestine intelligence activities (including covert activities intended to affect the political or governmental process), sabotage, or international terrorist activities, or activities in preparation for international terrorist activities; or who conspires with, or knowingly aids and abets a person engaging in such activities;

C5.2.3.2.1.2. A person who is an officer or employee of a foreign power;

C5.2.3.2.1.3. A person unlawfully acting for, or pursuant to the direction of, a foreign power. The mere fact that a person's activities may benefit or further the aims of a foreign power is not enough to bring that person under this paragraph, absent evidence that the person is taking direction from, or acting in knowing concert with, the foreign power;

C5.2.3.2.1.4. A corporation or other entity that is owned or controlled directly or indirectly by a foreign power; or

C5.2.3.2.1.5. A person in contact with, or acting in collaboration with, an intelligence or security service of a foreign power for the purpose of providing access to information or material classified by the United States to which such person has access.

C5.2.3.2.2. The electronic surveillance is necessary to obtain significant foreign intelligence or counterintelligence.

C5.2.3.2.3. The significant foreign intelligence or counterintelligence expected to be obtained from the electronic surveillance could not reasonably be obtained by other less intrusive collection techniques.

C5.2.3.3. Adescription of the significant foreign intelligence or counterintelligence expected to be obtained from the electronic surveillance.
C5.2.3.4. Adescription of the means by which the electronic surveillance will be effected.

C5.2.3.5. If physical trespass is required to effect the surveillance, a statement of facts supporting a finding that the means involve the least amount of intrusion that will accomplish the objective.

C5.2.3.6. A statement of period of time, not to exceed 90 days, for which the electronic surveillance is required.

C5.2.3.7. Adescription of the expected dissemination of the product of the surveillance, including a description of the procedures that will govern the retention and dissemination of communications of or concerning United States persons other than those targeted, acquired incidental to such surveillance.

C5.2.4. Electronic Surveillance in Emergency Situations. Notwithstanding paragraph C5.2.3., above, a DoD intelligence component may conduct surveillance directed at a United States person who is outside the United States in emergency situations under the following limitations:

C5.2.4.1. Officials designated in paragraph C5.2.5., below, may authorize electronic surveillance directed at a United States person outside the United States in emergency situations, when securing the prior approval of the Attorney General is not practical because:

C5.2.4.1.1. The time required would cause failure or delay in obtaining significant foreign intelligence or counterintelligence and such failure or delay would result in substantial harm to the national security;

C5.2.4.1.2. A person's life or physical safety is reasonably believed to be in immediate danger; or

C5.2.4.1.3. The physical security of a defense installation or Government property is reasonably believed to be in immediate danger.

C5.2.4.2. Except for actions taken under subparagraph C5.2.4.1.2., above, any official authorizing such emergency surveillance shall find that one of the criteria contained in subparagraph C5.2.3.2.1., above, is met. Such officials shall notify the DoD General Counsel promptly of any such surveillance, the reason for authorizing such surveillance on an emergency basis, and the expected results.
C5.2.4.3. The Attorney General shall be notified by the General Counsel, DoD, as soon as possible of the surveillance, the circumstances surrounding its authorization, and the results thereof, and such other information as may be required to authorize continuation of such surveillance.

C5.2.4.4. Electronic surveillance authorized pursuant to this section may not continue longer than the time required for a decision by the Attorney General and in no event longer than 72 hours.

# C5.2.5. Officials Authorized to Request and Approve Electronic Surveillance Outside the United States 

C5.2.5.1. The following officials may request approval of electronic surveillance outside the United States under paragraph C5.2.3., above, and approve emergency surveillance under paragraph C5.2.4., above:

C5.2.5.1.1. The Secretary and Deputy Secretary of Defense.
C5.2.5.1.2. The Secretaries and Under Secretaries of the Military Departments.

C5.2.5.1.3. The Director and Deputy Director of the National Security Agency/Chief, Central Security Service.

C5.2.5.2. Authorization for emergency electronic surveillance under paragraph C5.2.4., may also be granted by:

C5.2.5.2.1. Any general or flag officer at the overseas location in question, having responsibility for either the subject of the surveillance, or responsibility for the protection of the persons, installations, or property that is endangered, or

C5.2.5.2.2. The Deputy Director for Operations, National Security Agency.

## C5.3. PART3: SIGNALS INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

## C5.3.1. Applicability and Scope

C5.3.1.1. This procedure governs the conduct by the United States Signals Intelligence System of signals intelligence activities that involve the collection,
retention, and dissemination of foreign communications and military tactical communications. Such activities may incidentally involve the collection of information concerning United States persons without their consent, or may involve communications originated or intended for receipt in the United States, without the consent of a party thereto.

C5.3.1.2. This part of Procedure 5 shall be supplemented by a classified Annex promulgated by the Director, National Security Agency/Chief, Central Security Service, which shall also be approved by the Attorney General. That regulation shall provide that signals intelligence activities that constitute electronic surveillance, as defined in Parts 1, and 2 of this procedure, will be authorized in accordance with those parts. Any information collected incidentally about United States persons shall be subjected to minimization procedures approved by the Attorney General.

# C5.3.2. Explanation of Undefined Terms 

C5.3.2.1. Communications concerning a United States person are those in which the United States person is identified in the communication. A United States person is identified when the person's name, unique title, address or other personal identifier is revealed in the communication in the context of activities conducted by that person or activities conducted by others and related to that person. A reference to a product by brand name or manufacturer's name or the use of a name in a descriptive sense, as, for example, "Monroe Doctrine," is not an identification of a United States person.

C5.3.2.2. Interception means the acquisition by the United States Signals Intelligence system through electronic means of a nonpublic communication to which it is not an intended party, and the processing of the contents of that communication into an intelligible form, but not including the display of signals on visual display devices intended to permit the examination of the technical characteristics of the signals without reference to the information content carried by the signals.

C5.3.2.3. Military tactical communications means United States and allied military exercise communications within the United States and abroad necessary for the production of simulated foreign intelligence and counterintelligence or to permit an analysis of communications security.

C5.3.2.4. United States Person. For purposes of signals intelligence activities only, the following guidelines will apply in determining whether a person is a United States person:
C5.3.2.4.1. A person known to be currently in the United States will be treated as a United States person unless the nature of the person's communications or other available information concerning the person gives rise to a reasonable belief that such person is not a United States citizen or permanent resident alien.

C5.3.2.4.2. A person known to be currently outside the United States, or whose location is not known, will not be treated as a United States person unless the nature of the person's communications or other available information concerning the person give rise to a reasonable belief that such person is a United States citizen or permanent resident alien.

C5.3.2.4.3. A person known to be an alien admitted for permanent residence may be assumed to have lost status as a United States person if the person leaves the United States and it is known that the person is not in compliance with the administrative formalities provided by law that enable such persons to reenter the United States without regard to the provisions of law that would otherwise restrict an alien's entry into the United States. The failure to follow the statutory procedures provides a reasonable basis to conclude that such alien has abandoned any intention of maintaining status as a permanent resident alien.

C5.3.2.4.4. An unincorporated association whose headquarters are located outside the United States may be presumed not to be a United States person unless the collecting agency has information indicating that a substantial number of members are citizens of the United States or aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence.

C5.3.2.5. United States Signals Intelligence System means the unified organization for signals intelligence activities under the direction of the Director, National Security Agency/Chief, Central Security Service, comprised of the National Security Agency, the Central Security Service, the components of the Military Services authorized to conduct signals intelligence and such other entities (other than the Federal Bureau of Investigation) as are authorized by the National Security Council or the Secretary of Defense to conduct signals intelligence. FBI activities are governed by procedures promulgated by the Attorney General.

# C6. CHAPTER 6 

## PROCEDURE 6. CONCEALED MONITORING

## C6.1. APPLICABILITY AND SCOPE

C6.1.1. This procedure applies to concealed monitoring only for foreign intelligence and counterintelligence purposes conducted by a DoD intelligence component within the United States or directed against a United States person who is outside the United States where the subject of such monitoring does not have a. reasonable expectation of privacy, as explained in section 6.2., below, and no warrant would be required if undertaken for law enforcement purposes.

C6.1.2. Concealed monitoring in the United States for foreign intelligence and counterintelligence purposes where the subject of such monitoring has a reasonable expectation of privacy and a warrant would be required for law enforcement purposes shall be treated as "electronic surveillance within the United States" under Part 1 of Procedure 5, and processed pursuant to that procedure.

C6.1.3. Concealed monitoring for foreign intelligence and counterintelligence purposes of a United States person abroad where the subject of such monitoring has a reasonable expectation of privacy and a warrant would be required for law enforcement purposes shall be treated as "electronic surveillance outside the United States" under Part 2 of Procedure 5, and processed pursuant to that procedure.

C6.1.4. Concealed monitoring for foreign intelligence and counterintelligence purposes when the monitoring is a signals intelligence activity shall be conducted pursuant to Part 3 of Procedure 5.

## C6.2. EXPLANATION OF UNDEFINED TERMS

C6.2.1. Concealed monitoring means targeting by electronic, optical, or mechanical devices a particular person or a group of persons without their consent in a surreptitious and continuous manner. Monitoring is surreptitious when it is targeted in a manner designed to keep the subject of the monitoring unaware of it. Monitoring is continuous if it is conducted without interruption for a substantial period of time.

C6.2.2. Monitoring is within the United States if the monitoring device, or the target of the monitoring, is located within the United States.
C6.2.3. Whether concealed monitoring is to occur where the subject has a reasonable expectation of privacy is a determination that depends upon the circumstances of a particular case, and shall be made only after consultation with the legal office responsible for advising the DoD intelligence component concerned. Reasonable expectation of privacy is the extent to which a reasonable person in the particular circumstances involved is entitled to believe his or her actions are not subject to monitoring by electronic, optical, or mechanical devices. For example, there are ordinarily reasonable expectations of privacy in work spaces if a person's actions and papers are not subject to ready observation by others under normal working conditions. Conversely, a person walking out of his or her residence into a public street ordinarily would not have a reasonable expectation that he or she is not being observed or even photographed; however, such a person ordinarily would have an expectation of privacy within his or her residence.

# C6.3. PROCEDURES 

C6.3.1. Limitations On Use of Concealed Monitoring. Use of concealed monitoring under circumstances when the subject of such monitoring has no reasonable expectation of privacy is subject to the following limitations:

C6.3.1.1. Within the United States, a DoD intelligence component may conduct concealed monitoring only on an installation or facility owned or leased by the Department of Defense or otherwise in the course of an investigation conducted pursuant to the Agreement Between the Secretary of Defense and the Attorney General (reference $(\mathrm{g})$ ).

C6.3.1.2. Outside the United States, such monitoring may be conducted on installations and facilities owned or leased by the Department of Defense. Monitoring outside such facilities shall be conducted after coordination with appropriate host country officials, if such coordination is required by the governing Status of Forces Agreement, and with the Central Intelligence Agency.

C6.3.2. Required Determination. Concealed monitoring conducted under paragraph C6.3.1., requires approval by an official designated in paragraph C6.3.3., below, based on a determination that such monitoring is necessary to the conduct of assigned foreign intelligence or counterintelligence functions, and does not constitute electronic surveillance under Parts 1 or 2 of Procedure 5.

C6.3.3. Officials Authorized to Approve Concealed Monitoring. Officials authorized to approve concealed monitoring under this procedure include the Deputy
Under Secretary of Defense (Policy); the Director, Defense Intelligence Agency; the Director, National Security Agency; the Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence, Department of Army; the Director, Naval Intelligence; the Director of Intelligence, U.S. Marine Corps; the Assistant Chief of Staff, Intelligence, U.S. Air Force; the Commanding General, Army Intelligence and Security Command; the Director, Naval Investigative Service; and the Commanding Officer, Air Force Office of Special Investigations.

Thus, a branch, subsidiary, or office of an organization within the United States, which is physically located outside the United States, is not considered as an organization within the United States.

C10.2.4. Participation refers to any action undertaken within the structure or framework of the organization involved. Such actions include serving as a representative or agent of the organization; acquiring membership; attending meetings not open to the public, including social functions for the organization as a whole; carrying out the work or functions of the organization; and contributing funds to the organization other than in payment for goods or services. Actions taken outside the organizational framework, however, do not constitute participation. Thus, attendance at meetings or social gatherings that involve organization members, but are not functions or activities of the organization itself does not constitute participation.
C10.2.5. Participation is on behalf of an agency within the intelligence community when an employee is tasked or requested to take action within an organization for the benefit of such agency. Such employee may already be a member of the organization or may be asked to join. Actions undertaken for the benefit of an intelligence agency include collecting information, identifying potential sources or contacts, or establishing and maintaining cover. If a cooperating source furnishes information to an intelligence agency that he or she obtained by participation within an organization, but was not given prior direction or tasking by the intelligence agency to collect such information, then such participation was not on behalf of such agency.
C10.2.6. Participation is solely for personal purposes, if undertaken at the initiative and expense of the employee for the employee's benefit.

(U) This Policy 1-23 supersedes Directive 10-30, dated 20 September 1990, and Change One thereto, dated June 1998. The Associate Director for Policy endorsed an administrative update, effective 27 December 2007 to make minor adjustments to the policy. This 29 May 2009 administrative update includes changes due to the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 and in core training requirements.
(U) OPI: Office of General Counsel (OGC), 963-3121s
(U) No section of this document, regardless of classification, shall be released without approval from the Office of Policy and Records, DJP1.

# (U) POLICY 

1. (U) NSA/CSS shall collect, process, retain, and disseminate information about U.S. persons only as prescribed in DoD Directive 5240.1 (Reference a), DoD Regulation 5240.1-R (Reference e), orders issued by the Foreign intelligence Surveillance Court pursuant to reference b, and the Classified Annex to DoD Procedures under Executive Order 12333 (hereafter referred to as the Classified Annex; Reference f).

## (U) PROCEDURES

2. (U) Signals Intelligence. The signals intelligence (SIGINT) mission of the NSA/CSS is to collect, process, analyze, produce, and disseminate SIGINT information and data for foreign intelligence and counterintelligence purposes to support national and departmental missions. NSA/CSS shall intentionally collect only foreign communications. NSA/CSS shall not intentionally collect U.S. person communications without proper legal authorization. The Director, NSA/Chief, CSS (DIRNSA/CHCSS) may authorize exceptions only pursuant to the procedures contained in DoD Regulation 5240.1-R (Reference e) and the Classified Annex thereto (Reference f).
a. (U) Electronic surveillance, as defined in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, as amended (Reference b), requires a court order issued by a judge appointed pursuant to the Act or a certification of the Attorney General of the United States and the Director of National Intelligence issued pursuant to Section 105(b) of the Act. The DIRNSA/CHCSS or Deputy Director, NSA (D/DIR) must approve applications for a court order, which must be submitted through the DoD General Counsel to the Attorney General. The DIRNSA/CHCSS or D/DIR may contact the Attorney General in an emergency and the Attorney General may approve the surveillance pending subsequent court proceedings.
b. (U) Electronic surveillance, as defined in Appendix A to DoD Regulation 5240.1-R (Reference e), directed against U.S. persons who are outside the U.S. requires an order by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Court. In emergency situations (e.g., U.S. hostages overseas), as described in Procedure 5, Part 2., of Reference e, the DIRNSA/CHCSS, D/DIR or Senior Operations Officer at the National Security Operations Center may authorize electronic surveillance, after consulting with the Office
# SECRET//COMINT// 

of General Counsel (OGC). The Attorney General shall be notified promptly of any such surveillance.
3. (U) Information Assurance. National Security Directive (NSD) 42 (Reference g) and Executive Order 12333 (Reference c) designated DIRNSA as the National Manager for National Security Systems (e.g. NSA's Information Assurance (IA) mission) as that term is defined by 44 U.S. C. 3542(b)(2) (Reference h). In that capacity, and pursuant to those authorities as well as other applicable laws and policies, DIRNSA's responsibilities include examining national security systems and evaluating their vulnerability to foreign interception and exploitation. NSA, as an element of the Intelligence Community and pursuant to section 2.6(c) of Executive Order 12333, as amended, may provide specialized equipment, technical knowledge, or assistance of expert personnel for use by any U.S. Government department or agency having a national security system or a non-national security system. The Executive Order directs that provision of assistance by expert personnel shall be approved in each case by the general counsel of the providing element or department. The Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (Reference i) and implementing procedures agreed to by NSA/CSS and the National Institute of Standards and Technology also authorizes NSA/CSS to provide IA support for US government non-national security systems.
a. (U) Any IA activities undertaken by NSA/CSS, including those involving monitoring of official communications, shall be conducted in strict compliance with law, Executive Order and implementing procedures, and applicable Presidential directive. Any monitoring undertaken for communications security purposes ("COMSEC monitoring") shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of National Telecommunications and Information Systems Security Directive (NTISSD) No. 600 (Reference j) or other special procedures approved by the Attorney General.
b. (U) In addition to the responsibility to conduct COMSEC monitoring and to examine national security systems for vulnerabilities to foreign exploitation, NSD 42 (Reference g) also requires NSA/CSS to disseminate information on threats to national security systems, regardless of the source of the threat. Title II of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (Reference k) imposes similar requirements with respect to the protection of the United States' critical infrastructure.
c. (U) Pursuant to NSA/CSS Policy 1-2, "(U) Mission and Functions Statements with Service Level Agreements," (Reference l) and IAD's Mission and Functions Statement (Reference m), IAD performs all functions on behalf of the DIRNSA in fulfilling his role as National Manager for National Security Systems. Accordingly, the Information Assurance Director acts for DIRNSA/CHCSS in the issuance of written approval to conduct the information assurance activities assigned to NSA/CSS, including the conduct of activities that may result in the collection of U.S. person information as defined in DoD Regulation 5240.1-R (Reference e) and other applicable guidance.

## (U) ANNEX

## (U) CLASSIFIED ANNEX TO DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE PROCEDURES UNDER EXECUTIVE ORDER 12333

Sec. 1: Applicability and Scope (U)

These procedures implement sections 2.3, 2.4, and 2.6 (c) of Executive Order 12333 and supplement Procedure 5 of DoD Regulation 5240.1-R, previously approved by the Secretary of Defense and the Attorney General. They govern the conduct by the United States Signals Intelligence System of signals intelligence activities that involve the collection, retention and dissemination of communications originated or intended for receipt in the United States, and signals intelligence activities that are directed intentionally against the communications of a United States person who is outside the United States. These procedures also govern the collection, retention and dissemination of information concerning United States persons that is collected by the United States Signals Intelligence System including such activities undertaken by the National Association of the United States of the United States. These procedures do not apply to signals intelligence activities that are not required under Executive Order 12333 to be conducted pursuant to procedures approved by the Attorney General. Further, these procedures do not apply to signals intelligence activities directed against the radio communications of air and sea vessels for the purpose of collecting foreign intelligence regarding international narcotics trafficking or in support of federal law enforcement efforts to interdict such trafficking. Such signals intelligence activities are subject to a separate classified annex approved earlier by the Attorney General (See Annex J to United States Signals Intelligence Directive 18). Except for matters expressly authorized herein, the limitations contained in Department of Defense Regulation 5240.1-R also apply to the United States Signals Intelligence System. Reference should be made to those procedures with respect to matters of applicability and scope, definitions, policy and operational procedures not covered herein.

Sec. 2: Definitions (U)
(U) The following additional definitions or supplements to definitions in DoD Regulation 5240.1-R apply solely to this Classified Annex:

[^0]
[^0]:    (1) Agent of a Foreign Power. For purposes of signals intelligence activities which are not regulated by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), the term "agent of a foreign power" means:
    (a) a person who, for or on behalf of a foreign power, is engaged in clandestine intelligence activities, sabotage, or international terrorist activities, or activities in preparation for international terrorist activities, or who conspires with, or knowingly

    Annex to Policy 1-23
# SECRET//COMINT// 

aids and abets such a person engaging in such activities;
(b) a person who is an officer or employee of a foreign power;
(c) a person unlawfully acting for, or pursuant to the direction of, a foreign power. The mere fact that a person's activities may benefit or further the aims of a foreign power is not enough to bring that person under this subsection, absent evidence that the person is taking direction from, or acting in knowing concert with, the foreign power;
(d) a person in contact with or acting in collaboration with an intelligence or security service of a foreign power for the purpose of providing access to information or material classified by the United States to which such person has or has had access; or
(e) a corporation or other entity that is owned or controlled directly or indirectly by a foreign power.
(U) Communicant. The term "communicant" means a sender or intended recipient of a communication.
(U) Consent. For the purposes of signals intelligence activities, an agreement by an organization with the National Security Agency to permit collection of information shall be deemed valid consent if given on behalf of such organization by an official or governing body determined by the General Counsel, National Security Agency, to have actual or apparent authority to make such an agreement.

- Foreign Communication. The term "foreign communication" means a communication that involves a sender or an intended recipient who is outside the United States or that is entirely among foreign powers or between a foreign power and officials of a foreign power. Electronic surveillance within the United States targeted against communications entirely among foreign powers or between a foreign power and officials of a foreign power will be coordinated with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, including surveillances targeted against telephone communications or telecommunications that serve residential or non-official premises of a foreign power or foreign officials within the United States. This coordination is intended to satisfy the National Security Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation intelligence requirements, preclude duplication of effort, and ensure that appropriate minimization practices are developed and applied.
(U) Foreign Intelligence. The term "foreign intelligence" includes both positive foreign intelligence and counterintelligence.
-illicit Communication. The term "illicit communication" means a communication transmitted in violation of the Communications Act of 1934 and regulations thereunder or of international agreements which because of its explicit content, message characteristics, or
# SECRET//COMINT// 

method of transmission is reasonably believed to be a communication to or from an agent or agents of foreign powers, whether or not United States persons.
(U) Interception. The term "interception" means the acquisition by the United States Signals Intelligence System through electronic means of a nonpublic communication to which it is not an intended party, and the processing of the contents of that communication into an intelligence form but not including the display of signals on visual display devices intended to permit the examination of the technical characteristics of the signal without reference to the information content carried by the signal.
$\rightarrow$ International Commercial Communications. The term "international commercial Communications" means foreign communications transmitted internationally in whole or in part by one or more commercial or foreign government communications carriers, and includes, but is not limited to, International commercial communications may be wire, telephone or radio communications transmitted by high frequency, microwave, satellite or other mode of transmission.
$\rightarrow$ National Diplomatic Communications. The term "national diplomatic communications" includes all communications, regardless of the mode of transmission, transmitted by or to a foreign power and to which no United States person is a communicant. The official communications of an international organization composed of foreign governments are included in the meaning of this term, provided, however that the communications of official representatives of the United States are not included.
$\rightarrow$ Selection. The term "selection," as applied to manual and mechanical processing activities, means the intentional insertion of a name, cable, TELEX, or other address and answer back or other alpha-numeric device into a computer scan dictionary or manual scan guide for the purpose of identifying messages of interest and isolating them for further processing.
$\rightarrow$ Selection Term. The term "selection term" means the composite of individual terms used to effect or defeat selection of particular communications for the purpose of interception. It comprises the entire term or series of terms so used, but not any segregable term contained herein. It applies to both mechanical and manual processing.
(U) Technical Data Base. The term "technical data base" means information retained for cryptanalytic or traffic analytic purposes.
![img-6.jpeg](img-6.jpeg)
$\rightarrow$ United States Person. For purposes of intentionally collecting the communications of a particular person, the term "United States person," in addition to the meaning in the Appendix to DoD Regulation 5240.1-R, includes any alien known to be presently in the United States; any unincorporated association of such aliens or American citizens; the United States

Annex to Policy 1-23

operations, office, branch, or representative of a corporation incorporated abroad; any corporation or corporate subsidiary incorporated in the United States; and any U.S. flag nongovernmental aircraft or vessel: Provided, however, that the term "U.S. person" shall not include (i) non-permanent resident aliens and entities in the United States that have diplomatic immunity as determined in accordance with Subsection 4.B; or (ii) a foreign power or powers as defined in Section 101 (a)(1)-(3) of FISA.

Sec. 3: Policy (U)
(U) The Director, National Security Agency, is assigned responsibility for signals intelligence collection and processing activities and communications security activities. In order to assure that these activities are conducted in accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 12333, the Director, or his designee, will issue appropriate directives and instructions implementing these procedures and governing the conduct of the United States Signals Intelligence System and the activities of communications security entities.

It is the policy of the United States Signals Intelligence System to collect, retain, and disseminate foreign communications and military tactical communications. It is recognized, however, that the United States Signals Intelligence System may incidentally intercept nonforeign communications, including those of or concerning United States persons, in the course of authorized collection of foreign communications. The United States Signals Intelligence System makes every reasonable effort, through surveys and technical means, to reduce to the maximum extent possible the number of such incidental intercepts acquired in the conduct of its operations. Information derived from these incidentally intercepted non-foreign communications may be disseminated to the Federal Bureau of Investigation when the information is foreign intelligence or counterintelligence or indicates a threat to the physical safety of any person. Dissemination of such information is also governed by these procedures and applicable minimization procedures approved in accordance with FISA. Specific communications sent from or intended for receipt by the United States persons are not intercepted deliberately by the United States Signals Intelligence System unless specific authorization for such interception has been obtained in accordance with these procedures.

The President has authorized, and the Attorney General hereby specifically approves, interception by the United States Signals Intelligence System of:

* National Diplomatic Communications;
* International Commercial Communications;
* Illicit Communications;
* United States and Allied Military exercise communications;
# SECRET//COMINT// 

* Signals collected during the search of the signals environment for foreign communications that may be developed into sources of signals intelligence;
* Signals collected during the monitoring of foreign electronic surveillance activities directed at United States communications consistent with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978; and
* Signals collected during the testing and training of personnel in the use of signals intelligence collection equipment in the United States consistent with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978.

Sec. 4: Procedures (U)
A. $\leftrightarrows$ Signals Intelligence: Communications of, or concerning, United States persons. The United States Signals Intelligence System may collect, process, retain and disseminate foreign communications that are also communications of, or concerning, United States persons. Communications of, or concerning, United States will be treated in the following manner.

## 1. Collection

(a) $\leftrightarrows \leftrightarrows$ Communications of or concerning a United States person may be intercepted intentionally or selected deliberately through use of a selection term or otherwise only:
(1) with the consent of such United States person. Where a United States person has consented, by completion of the appropriate Consent Agreement appended hereto, to the use of a selection term intended to intercept communications originating by or referencing that person, the National Security Agency may use such selection term to select foreign communications; or
(2) with specific prior court order pursuant to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 where applicable. All United States Signals Intelligence System requests for such court orders or approvals shall be forwarded by the Director, National Security Agency for certification by the Secretary of Defense or the Deputy Secretary of Defense (in case of the unavailability of both of these officials and in emergency situations, certification may be granted by another official authorized by executive order to certify such requests), and thence to the Attorney General; or
(3) with the specific prior approval of the Director, National Security Agency, in any case in which the United States person is reasonably believed to be held captive by a foreign power or by a group engaged in international terrorist activities. The Attorney General will be notified when the Director authorizes selection of communications concerning a United States person pursuant to this provision; or
# SECRET//COMINT/1 

(4) with specific prior approval by the Attorney General based on a finding by the Attorney General that there is probable cause to believe the United States person is an agent of a foreign power and that the purpose of the interception or selection is to collect significant foreign intelligence. Such approvals shall be limited to a period of time not to exceed ninety days for individuals and one year for entities.
![img-7.jpeg](img-7.jpeg)
selected deliberately (through the use of a selection term or otherwise), upon certification in writing by the Director, NSA to the Attorney General. Such certification shall take the form of the Certification Notice appended hereto. An information copy shall be forwarded to the Deputy Secretary of Defense. Collection may commence upon the Director, NSA's certification. In addition, the Director, NSA shall advise the Attorney General and the Deputy Secretary of Defense on an annual basis of all such collection.
(c) For purposes of the application of Parts 1, 2 and 3 of Procedure 5 (and subsection 4.A. 1 (a) of this annex) to the activities of the United States Signals Intelligence System, any deliberate interception, selection or use of a selection term shall be deemed to constitute electronic surveillance; and "significant foreign intelligence" shall mean not only those items of information that are in themselves significant, but also items that are reasonably believed, based on the experience of the United States Signals Intelligence System, when analyzed together with other items, to make a contribution to the discovery of "significant foreign intelligence."
(d) Emergencies:
(1) The emergency provision in Section D of Part 2, Procedure 5, of DoD 5240.1-R, may be employed to authorize deliberate selection of communications of, or concerning, a United States persons defined in the Appendix to DoD Regulation 5240.1-R, when that person is outside the United States.
(2) If the United States Signals Intelligence System is intentionally collecting the communications of or concerning a non-resident alien abroad who enters the United States in circumstances that suggest that the alien is an agent of a foreign power, collection of the communications of that alien may continue for a period not to exceed seventy-two hours after it is learned that the alien is in the United States while the United States Signals Intelligence system seeks authority to continue the surveillance from the Attorney General pursuant to these procedures.
# SECRET//COMINT// 

Communications acquired after the target is known to be in the United States, and that are not solely of, or concerning, U.S. citizens or permanent resident aliens, may be disseminated for foreign intelligence purposes until such time as diplomatic status is established or Attorney General approval is obtained. In those instances in which the diplomatic status of the alien is established, or Attorney General approval for continued surveillance is obtained, communications of, or concerning, the alien may be disseminated in accordance with subsection 4.A. 4 of these procedures.
(3) If the United States Signals Intelligence System is intentionally collecting communications of, or concerning, a United States citizen or permanent resident alien abroad, it must terminate the surveillance promptly upon learning that person is in the United States. Electronic surveillance may be reinstituted only in accordance with FISA. In the event communications of, or concerning, the target continue to be collected before termination can be effected, processing and use of information derived from such communications shall be restricted to the greatest extent possible and special care shall be taken to ensure that such information is not disseminated for any purpose unless authorized in accordance with the provisions of FISA.
(e) (5)(5)) Communications transmitted on with a terminal in the United States that services a U.S. person may be targeted for interception upon certification in writing by the Director, NSA to the Attorney General that the target of the collection is a foreign entity and that the purpose of the collection is to obtain foreign intelligence. The certification shall take the form of the Certification Notice appended hereto. Collection may commence upon the Director, NSA's certification. In addition, the Director, NSA will advise the Attorney General on an annual basis of all such collection. The Deputy Secretary of Defense will be provided information copies of all certifications sent to the Attorney General.
(f) (5)(5)) Provided the proposed monitoring is not otherwise regulated by Section 4.A. 1 (a)-(e), voice and facsimile communications with one communicant in the United States may be targeted for intercept only with the prior approval of the Attorney General or the Director, National Security Agency, as set forth below, unless those communications occur over channels used exclusively by a foreign power. The Director, National Security Agency, may amnose the repeating of such communications if technical devices are employed that limit acquisition by the National Security Agency to communications where the target is a non-U.S. person located outside the United States or to specific forms of communications used by those targets.
communications. In those cases in which it is not possible to use such technical devices, the Attorney General must approve the targeting. Approvals granted by the Director, NSA under this provision shall be available for review by the Attorney General.
(g) (C) 3 of this Annex.

Annex to Policy 1-23
Dated: 11 March 2004
A-7
(h) (1) Use of direction finding solely to determine the location of a transmitter does not constitute electronic surveillance or collection even if directed at transmitters believed to be used by United States persons. Unless collection of the communications is otherwise authorized pursuant to this annex, the contents of communications to which a United States person is a party monitored in the course of direction finding shall be used solely to identify the transmitter.

# 2. Retention (U) 

(1) Foreign communications of, or concerning, United States persons that are intercepted by the United States Signals Intelligence System may be retained in their original form or as transcribed only:
(a) if processed so as to eliminate any reference to United States persons;
(b) if necessary to the maintenance of technical data bases. Retention for this purpose is permitted for a period sufficient to allow a thorough exploitation and to permit access to data that are, or are reasonably believed likely to become, relevant to a current or future intelligent requirement. Sufficient duration may vary with the nature of the exploitation. In the context of a cryptanalytic effort, sufficient duration may consist of a period of time during which encrypted material is subject to, or of use in, cryptanalysis. In the case of international commercial communications that may contain the identity of United States persons and that are not enciphered or otherwise thought to contain secret meaning, sufficient duration is one year unless the Deputy Director for Operations, National Security Agency, determines in writing that retention for a longer period is required to respond to authorized foreign intelligence or counterintelligence requirements; or
(c) if dissemination of such communications without elimination of references to such United States persons would be permitted under section 4.A. 4 below.

## 3. Processing (U)

(a) Foreign communications of, or concerning, United States persons must be processed in accordance with the following limitations:
(1) When a selection term is intended to intercept a communication on the basis of encipherment or some other aspect of the content of the communication, rather than the identity of a communicant or the fact that the communication mentions a particular individual:
(a) No selection term may be used that is based on content and that is reasonably likely to result in the interception of communications to or from a United States person, or which has in the past resulted in the interception of a significant number of such
# SECRET//COMINT/ 

communications, unless there is reasonable cause to believe that foreign intelligence or counterintelligence will be obtained by use of such a selection term.
(b) All such selection terms shall be reviewed annually by the Deputy Director for Operations, National Security Agency, or his designee to determine whether there is reasonable cause to believe that foreign intelligence or counterintelligence will be obtained by the use of these selection terms. The review of such selection terms shall include an examination of whether such selection terms have in the past resulted in the acquisition of foreign intelligence.
(c) Selection terms based on content that have resulted or that are reasonably likely to result in the interception of communications to or from a United States person shall be designed to defeat, to the extent practicable under the circumstances, the interception of such communications not containing foreign intelligence.
(2) Foreign communications collected by the United States Signals Intelligence System or other authorized entities may be forwarded to the National Security Agency as intercepted. This applies to forwarding to intermediate processing facilities, including those of authorized collaborating centers pursuant to written agreements, provided such forwarding does not result in the production by the United States Signals Intelligence System of information in violation of these procedures.
(b) $\leftrightarrows \nRightarrow$ Except as provided in (b)(1), radio communications that pass over channels with a terminal within the United States must be processed by use of selection terms, unless these communications occur over channels used exclusively by a foreign power.
(1) Radio communications that pass over channels with a terminal in the United States may be processed without the use of selection terms only when necessary to determine whether a channel contains communications of foreign intelligence interest which the National Security Agency wishes to collect. Processing under this section may not exceed two hours without approval of the Deputy Director for Operations, National Security Agency, and shall in any event be limited to the minimum amount of time necessary to determine the nature of communications on the channel and the amount of such communications that include foreign intelligence. Once it is determined that the channel contains a sufficient amount of communications of foreign intelligence interest to warrant collection and exploitation to produce foreign intelligence, additional processing of the channel must utilize selection terms.

## 4. Dissemination $(\mathrm{U})$

$\Rightarrow \Rightarrow$ Dissemination of signals intelligence derived from foreign communications of, or concerning, United States persons is governed by Procedure 4 of DoD Regulation 5240.1-R. Dissemination of signals intelligence shall be limited to authorized signals intelligence consumers in accordance with requirements and tasking established pursuant to Executive Order 12333. Dissemination of information that is not pursuant to such requirements or tasking that

Annex to Policy 1-23
Dated: 11 March 2004
# SECRET//COMINT// 

constitutes foreign intelligence or counterintelligence or that is otherwise authorized under Procedure 4 shall be limited to those departments or agencies that have subject matter responsibility. Dissemination of the identity of a United Stated person is authorized if it meets one of the following criteria, each of which is also deemed to meet the standard of "necessary to understand or assess" the importance of foreign intelligence information (otherwise, the identity of the United States person must be replaced by a generic term, e.g., United States citizen or United States corporation):
(a) The United States person has consented to the use of communications of or concerning him or her and has executed the applicable consent form;
(b) the information is available publicly;
(c) the identity of the United States person is that of a senior official in the Executive Branch. When this exemption is applied, the Deputy Director for Operations, National Security Agency, will ensure that domestic political or personal information is not retained or disseminated;
(d) the communication or information indicates that the United States person may be an agent of a foreign power;
(e) the communication or information indicates that the United States person may be:
(1) a foreign power as defined in Section 101 (a)(4) or (6) of FISA;
(2) residing outside the United States and holding an official position in the government or military forces of a foreign power such that information about his or her activities would constitute foreign intelligence;
(3) a corporation or other entity that is owned or controlled directly or indirectly by a foreign power; or
(4) acting in collaboration with an intelligence or security service of a foreign power and the United States person has, or has had, access to information or material classified by the United States;
(f) the communication or information indicates that the United States person may be the target of intelligence activities of a foreign power;
(g) the communication or information indicates that the United States person is engaged in the unauthorized disclosure of classified national security information;
(h) the communication or information indicates that the United States person may be engaging in international terrorist activities;
# SECRET//COMINT// 

(i) the interception of the United States person's communications was authorized by a court order issued pursuant to Section 105 of FISA or by Attorney General approval issued pursuant to Section 4.A. 1 of this annex and the communication may relate to the foreign intelligence or counterintelligence purpose of the surveillance;
(j) the communication or information indicates a possible threat to the safety of a person or organization, including those who are targets, victims, or hostages of international terrorist organizations;
(k) the communication or information indicates that the United States person may be engaged in international narcotics trafficking activities;
(1) the communication or information is evidence that a crime has been, is being, or is about to be committed, provided that dissemination is for law enforcement purposes; or
(m) the identity of the United States person is otherwise necessary to understand foreign intelligence or counterintelligence or assess its importance. Access to technical data bases will be restricted to signals intelligence collection and analytic personnel. Requests for access from other personnel or entities shall be referred to the Deputy Director for Operations, National Security Agency. Domestic communications in which all communicants are United States persons shall be disposed of upon recognition, provided that technical data concerning frequency and channel usage may be retained for collection avoidance purposes.
B. $\leftrightarrows$ Signals Intelligence: Communications of, or Concerning, Aliens and Entities

The United States Signals Intelligence System may intentionally intercept the international communications of non-permanent resident aliens and entities in the United States

(b) are enciphered or appear to contain secret meaning;
(c) are necessary to ensure efficient signals intelligence collection or to avoid the collection of unwanted signals; or
(d) reveal vulnerability of United States communications security.
2. Retention and Processing. Communications originating or intended for receipt in the United States, or originated or intended for receipt by United States persons, shall be processed in accordance with Section 4.A.3, provided that information necessary for cataloging the constituent elements of the signal environment may be produced and retained if such information does not identify a United States person. Information revealing a United States communications security vulnerability may be retained.
3. Dissemination. Information necessary for cataloging the constituent elements of the signal environment may be disseminated to the extent such information does not identify United States persons, except that communication equipment nomenclature may be disseminated. Information that reveals a vulnerability of United States communications security may be dissemination to the appropriate security authorities.
E. (9/54) Foreign Electronic Surveillance Activities. The United States Signals Intelligence System may collect information related to the conduct of electronic surveillance activities by foreign powers conducted within the United States against communications originated or intended for receipt in the United States. Collection efforts must be reasonably designed to intercept, or otherwise obtain only the results of such foreign surveillance efforts, and to avoid, to the extent feasible, the intercept of other communications. Such activities shall be conducted pursuant to orders of the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.
F. (U) Assistance to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

1. In accordance with the provisions of Section 2.6 (c) of E.O. 12333, the National Security Agency may provide specialized equipment and technical knowledge to the Federal Bureau of Investigation to assist the Bureau in the conduct of its lawful functions.

SUBJECT: Directive-Type Memorandum (DTM) 08-052 - DoD Guidance for Reporting Questionable Intelligence Activities and Significant or Highly Sensitive Matters

References: See Attachment 1
Purpose. This DTM implements recent Executive Branch guidance in Director of National Intelligence and Chairman, Intelligence Oversight Board Memorandum (Reference (a)) concerning the criteria and requirements for reporting intelligence oversight matters and directs compliance with the guidance contained in Attachment 2. It establishes the procedures to ensure complete and standardized reporting by the DoD Intelligence Components and other entities involved in intelligence activities, which include both foreign intelligence and counterintelligence activities. This DTM is effective immediately; it shall be incorporated into DoD 5240.1-R (Reference (b)) within 180 days. Nothing in this DTM is intended to alter reporting requirements established by statute or departmental policy.

Applicability. This DTM applies to OSD, the Military Departments, the Office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Joint Staff, the Combatant Commands, the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Defense, the Defense Agencies,
the DoD Field Activities, and all other organizational entities in the Department of Defense (hereafter referred to collectively as the "DoD Components").

Policy. Questionable intelligence activities and significant or highly sensitive matters involving intelligence activities may have serious implications for the execution of DoD missions. It is DoD policy that senior leaders and policymakers within the Government be made aware of events that may erode the public trust in the conduct of DoD intelligence operations. Reference (b), DoD Directive 5148.11 (Reference (c)), and Executive Order (E.O.) 13462 (Reference (d)) require that such matters be reported to the Intelligence Oversight Board (IOB), a component of the President's Intelligence Advisory Board, and the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) as appropriate. The Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Intelligence Oversight (ATSD(IO)) is the principal staff assistant for intelligence oversight matters and shall serve as the conduit for all reporting to the IOB.

Reporting Requirements and Procedures. Reporting guidance is contained in Attachment 2. The quarterly report to the ATSD(IO) is exempt from licensing in accordance with Chapter 4, subparagraphs C4.4.1 and C4.4.8, of DoD 8910.1-M (Reference (e)).

Releasability. UNLIMITED. This DTM is approved for public release and is available on the Internet from the DoD Issuances Web Site at http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives.

## PROCEDURES FOR REPORTING OUESTIONABLE INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES AND SIGNIFICANT OR HIGHLY SENSITIVE MATTERS

## 1. REPORTING PARAMETERS

a. The DoD Components shall report the following matters to the ATSD(IO) in accordance with References (a) and (d).
(1) Questionable Intelligence Activity. An intelligence activity, as defined in E.O. 12333 (Reference (f)), that may be unlawful or contrary to executive order, Presidential directive, or applicable DoD policy governing that activity.
(2) Significant or Highly Sensitive Matters. A development or circumstance involving an intelligence activity or intelligence personnel that could impugn the reputation or integrity of the DoD Intelligence Community or otherwise call into question the propriety of an intelligence activity. Such matters might be manifested in or by an activity:
(a) Involving congressional inquiries or investigations.
(b) That may result in adverse media coverage.
(c) That may impact on foreign relations or foreign partners.
(d) Related to the unauthorized disclosure of classified or protected information, such as information identifying a sensitive source and method. Reporting under this paragraph does not include reporting of routine security violations.
(3) Crimes Reported to the Attorney General. Any intelligence activity that has been or will be reported to the Attorney General, or that must be reported to the Attorney General as required by law or other directive, including crimes reported to the Attorney General as required by Department of Justice-DoD Memorandum of Understanding (Reference (g)).
b. Unless extenuating circumstances exist, the ATSD(IO) will be notified prior to briefings of any congressional committee or member of Congress concerning intelligence matters identified in paragraphs 1.a.(1), 1.a.(2), and 1.a.(3) of this attachment. Should extenuating circumstances, in fact, delay notification to the ATSD(IO) until after the briefing, then the ATSD(IO) will be notified of the outcome of the briefing at the first opportunity thereafter.
c. The DoD Component assigned to or conducting intelligence activities may establish internal organizational reporting responsibilities pursuant to that Component's internal policies and regulations.
2. SUBMISSION OF REPORTS. DoD Components assigned to conduct intelligence and counterintelligence activities shall submit reports to the ATSD(IO) in accordance with the following guidance.
a. Report questionable intelligence activities of a serious nature and all significant or highly sensitive matters immediately. Such reports may be made by any secure means. Oral reports should be documented with a written report as soon as possible thereafter.
b. Report questionable intelligence activities not of a serious nature quarterly. Reporting periods shall be based on the calendar year. The first report for each calendar year shall cover January 1 through March 31. Succeeding reports shall follow at 3-month intervals. Quarterly reports are due to the ATSD(IO) by the 15th day of the month following the end of the quarter. Quarterly reports will describe all questionable intelligence activities as well as significant or highly sensitive matters identified during the quarter. Quarterly reports are routinely submitted to the ATSD(IO) through normal modes of routing and transmission (e.g., chain of command, hard or soft copy). Quarterly reports are required even if no reportable matters occurred during the reporting period.
c. Reporting DoD Components will format all reports as follows:
(1) Assignment of a Case Number for Each Incident. Except where the volume of incident investigations that have been reported and closed within the same reporting quarter makes the assigning of a case number to each case impracticable, a case number that runs consecutively and identifies the reported incident by reporting agency, Military Department, or Combatant Command and calendar year shall be assigned to each incident. For example: "DIA 2009 - 04" would indicate the fourth incident reported by DIA in calendar year 2009. Use this number each time the incident is mentioned in initial reports, and in update and close-out reports. A case number will be assigned to all reported incidents that, at a minimum, are the subject of an ongoing investigation.
(2) Information to be Included in Each Report. For each incident reported, include the following information as it becomes available.
(a) A narrative describing each incident reported.
(b) An explanation of why the incident is being reported either as a potential violation of law, potentially contrary to executive order or Presidential directive, or a potential violation of Reference (b) and/or agency or Military Department procedures implementing Reference (f). Cite the portions of relevant law, order, policy, or regulation as it is determined.
(c) An explanation of why the incident is considered a significant or highly sensitive matter, if so reported.
(d) An analysis of how or why the incident occurred.
(e) An assessment of the anticipated impact of the reported incident on national security or international relations, as well as any mitigation efforts, including success and failures of such efforts. If there has been no impact or no impact is anticipated, the report should so state.
(f) Remedial action taken or planned to prevent recurrence of the incident.
(g) An assessment of any impact the reported incident may have on civil liberties or protected privacy rights.
(h) A description of actions taken if the incident concerns information improperly acquired, handled, used, or destroyed.
(i) Any additional information considered relevant for purposes of fully informing the Secretary and/or Deputy Secretary of Defense, the IOB, and the DNI and providing context about the incident.
d. Each quarterly report should be organized under the major headings of "New Incidents" and "Updates on Previously Reported Incidents." The latter heading includes incidents still under inquiry as well as those resolved and closed during the quarter.
e. Additionally, each quarterly report will contain a summary of gravity, frequency, trends and patterns of the questionable intelligence activities, and/or significant or highly sensitive incidents reported during that quarter, to the extent that they can be determined. Otherwise, the summary should be provided, as the information becomes available, in a subsequent quarterly report.
f. The quarterly report shall include a description of any inspection findings or intelligence oversight program developments, such as publication of a revised intelligence oversight regulation, that the reporting DoD Component believes is significant. Neither training reports nor inspection schedules shall be included in the
quarterly report to ATSD(IO). DoD Components shall monitor compliance with training requirements and inspection schedules.
g. Reporting shall not be delayed or postponed pending an investigation, command inquiry, or legal proceeding.
3. PROHIBITED USE OF THIS ATTACHMENT. This attachment shall not be used to prepare the Annual Intelligence Oversight Report to Congress, which is signed by the Secretary of Defense. Instructions for preparing the Annual Intelligence Oversight Report to Congress will be issued by the ATSD(IO) in November of each year; the Annual Report will be due to the ATSD(IO) January 31 of each year.
