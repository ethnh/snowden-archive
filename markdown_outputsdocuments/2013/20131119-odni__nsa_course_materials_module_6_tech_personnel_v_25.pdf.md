(THiNEiNE) (OGC Attorney): During this part of our trip, we discuss several topics of particular interest to those of you in technical roles, or supervising staff in a technical role, supporting the BR and PR/TT Bulk Metadata Programs. It is important for you to remember that the essential support you provide enables all of the roles to perform their BR- and PR/TT-related work in compliance with applicable legal documents and relevant authorities. As we discussed in Module 5, because of this great responsibility, technical personnel have been given tremendous access to touch the data in order to make it available and usable for the analysts.
(THiNEiNE) (Technical Character): In this module we are going to discuss the authorizations, roles, and responsibilities of the Technical Personnel. This module will enable you to:

- (Tg)SHiNE- identify the various technical roles that support the BR and PR/TT Bulk Metadata Programs
- (U) Identify the responsibilities of each of the technical roles
- (U) Recognize key points of the compliance certification process for mission systems and data flows
- (T) Practice applying BR and PR/TT authorities in real-life scenarios applicable to technical personnel

(UIIFQWQI(Technical Character): Let's examine more closely the work roles required for the production of information. The category of technical staff currently includes the technical professionals in NSAT and MISAT and Mission Capabilities staff within the Technology Directorate (TD) organizations. As we proceed through this module you will find out more about the roles in each of these three organizations.

TEHSHNFI Note that in addition to these key roles, there are other technical roles that are important to the implementation of these programs. These roles include individuals involved in the acquisition, processing, presentation, storage, retention, and support to operations which are authorized under the BR and PR/TT Orders.

# TEMPERIUM 

TEMPERINE (Technical Character): You will recall that Mission Capabilities supports collection and metadata and other branches of Mission Capabilities support storage, presentation, and maintenance of the metadata. For the latter, the staff is typically database management and user interface professionals who are responsible for developing, maintaining, and operating the that store and present BR and PR/TT metadata, as well as
(TEMPERINP) Some of the rules that apply to Mission Capabilities include:

- Metadata must be maintained in secure MSA repositories
- Data items must be identifiable as BR or PR/TT metadata
- Implement technical controls to prevent unauthorized access
- Implement technical controls to restrict intelligence analysis queries to RAS-approved identifiers (e.g. the EAR)
- Implement technical controls to provide reasonable assurance that the results of intelligence analysis queries remain within the authorized number of hops
- Create auditable records of all intelligence analysis queries
- Destroy all metadata before the end of the five year authorized retention period (no exceptions for backup data)
- $\square$
- This staff will come in contact with human intelligible BR and PR/TT metadata.

(TEXISINE) For BR, $\prod$ performs unique functions to include:

- Normalizing all of the disparate data formats
- Reviewing the data to validate that the records include only data: 1
- Assist in ensuring that the data to be presented to the analysts will be in a usable format
- Providing operational support as necessary to intelligence analysts; support is limited to RAS-approved identifiers within the authorized number of hops
![img-14.jpeg](img-14.jpeg)
recreating their query results is not one of the roles and responsibilities of the technical personnel.
(TS/SS/INF) Incorrect. The correct answer is d). Running an intelligence analysis query using a non-RAS-approved identifier for an analyst who is experiencing problems recreating their query results is not one of the roles and responsibilities of the technical personnel.

| (TU//G//N//) (Technical Character): Next we will discuss the compliance certification process used by technical personnel who develop mission <br> technologies to include those supporting the BR and PR/TT Programs. Compliance certification is a mandatory check for all systems handling U.S. person <br> or FISA data. Guidelines governing the certification process are maintained by the TD Compliance Office. This process supports compliance with the <br> applicable laws and authorities and supports the NSA Way. The NSA Way is a unified framework for building large (or small), complex, primarily software <br> systems that meet the diverse needs of NSA missions. An important point is that compliance should be integrated into the development process. |  |  |  |  |  |

(TOPSYN) (Technical Character): The goal of the compliance certification process is to integrate compliance into the development phase. The gates shown in the compliance process represent distinct requirements that must be satisfied in order to provide reasonable assurance of compliance. The architects of the new technology develop engineering documents to support these requirements. The TD certification group reviews the artifacts to verify the compliance process requirements are being met.
(TOPSYN) The compliance certification process begins by registering in $\square$ Access the site by typing $\square$ into your web browser. Once registration is complete, you will receive a requirements pa
(UIFOUO) Compliance is an ongoing process. Any change or update to previously certified software requires recertification to remain compliant. In other words, if you develop a modification or upgrade to the software, then you need to register the software modification in $\square$ to begin the recertification process.
TTOMSHNP Formal approval is required for all new and/or different BR and PR/TT systems. Under no circumstances can a change be made to a software system (even for testing purposes) without going through the compliance certification (or recertification) process.

- FOODING (Technical Character): The Collection Strategies and Requirements Center (CSRC) is responsible for dataflow governance, which provides reasonable assurance of accountability and compliance for NSA mission data as it moves throughout NSA systems. This is critical to protect the data, and when we are talking about volumes of U.S. person data you can understand why this is so important.
- FORMING The process begins by submitting a dataflow request (usually done by the system builder or access owner) for a new dataflow solution. Then some level of research is needed to determine the type of request and associated needs. Once the requirements are determined, a new processing capability may be developed, or an existing flow may be reconfigured to meet the new requirement. The solution must then be tested and obtain official sign-off at which time CSRC authorization to operate would be issued.
(U/FOUO) In general, it comes to consider the dataflow governance process include (but are not limited to):
- Replacing an existing repository
- Inserting a process or system into the flow
- Adding a new mission element
- Legacy migration (moving an existing unmanaged flow to a managed flow)
- FORMING Formal approval is required for all new and/or different BR and PR/TT data flows. Under no circumstances can a change be made to a data flow (even for testing purposes) without going through the dataflow governance process.
(U/FOUO) To find out more about the dataflow process, please refer to the Dataflow webpage by typing 'go dataflow' in your web browser.

(FIGHINF)-(Technical Character): As we stated earlier in the course, the bulk metadata includes sensitive data that must be protected accordingly. By nature of the kinds of technical support provided to the BR and PR/TT programs, technical personnel have the authority and unrestricted access to touch unminimized/unevaluated (or raw), and very sensitive data (that contains a lot of U.S. person identifiers). Remember, we need to maintain a clear distinction between the roles of technical and analytical personnel. All personnel are held to a high standard of integrity, but in your technical role you must be particularly cautious because the tools you work with do not provide the same safeguards as those tools used by the analytical personnel.
(TSMSHNF) In conclusion, it is your responsibility to keep the BR and PR/TT information within the confines of those who have the proper authorizations to touch and view the data.
(U) Now that we have completed this part of our road trip, you should be able to:

- (TSMSHNF) Identify the various technical roles that support the BR and PR/TT Bulk Metadata Programs
