(TS/ISI/NF) (OGC Attorney): During this part of our trip we discuss the BR and PR/TT metadata in greater detail. Specifically, we look at the metadata which may be obtained, how bulk metadata is collected under these authorities, and the storage restrictions with which NSA must comply. Other modules will address restrictions related to the dissemination and processing of the bulk metadata.
(U) This module will enable you to:

- (TS/ISI/NF) Distinguish differences between BR and PR/TT metadata
- (TS/ISI/NF) Recognize restrictions placed on BR and PR/TT metadata storage and retention by the BR and PR/TT Bulk Metadata Programs
(TS/ISI/NF) Note that other restrictions will be addressed in other modules.

(TS/JSI/NF) (OGC Attorney): Let's take a look at the BR Bulk Metadata Program. As we mentioned in Module 1, the BR Primary Order pertains specifically to telephony metadata which is kept by U.S.-based telecommunications companies as part of their normal business operations. They retain this information, in part, so they can send their subscribers a bill every month.
(TS/JSI/NF) The business records include, for example, originating and terminating telephone numbers, International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI), International Mobile Station Equipment Identity (IMEI), trunk identifiers, and telephone calling card numbers.

\{TS//SI//NF\} (OGC Attorney): As you can imagine, NSA is interested in the same kinds of telephony information for the U.S. and contact chaining analysis. Because these business records, also known as call detail records (CDRs), are retained by the U.S.-based telecommunication companies as part of their normal business operations. However, the FISC stipulates that we are not permitted to obtain the content of an of a subscriber or customer.

(TSI/SI/NF) (OGC Attorney): Both Orders mandate that the BR and PR/TT bulk metadata must be stored in repositories within secure networks under NSA's control. The methods for storing the results of approved queries of the bulk metadata will be explained in Module 4. BR and PR/TT bulk metadata may only be stored in authorized and specifically designated repositories.
(TSI/SI/NF) The FISC also requires NSA to mark and tag the BR and PR/TT metadata so that software and other control mechanisms may provide reasonable assurance that the information is only accessed by authorized personnel who have completed the required training and have the necessary credentials.
(TSI/SI/NF) The bulk BR and PR/TT metadata coming into the repositories has an expiration date set by the FISC. NSA does not have the authority to maintain the unselected BR and PR/TT metadata indefinitely. The FISC permits NSA to maintain this metadata for 60 months from the date of collection at which time it must be destroyed.
