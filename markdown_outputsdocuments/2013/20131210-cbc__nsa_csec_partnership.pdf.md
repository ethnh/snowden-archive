Subject: (U//FOUO) NSA Intelligence Relationship with Canada's Communications Security Establishment Canada (CSEC)
(U) Introduction
(U//FOUO) The U.S.-Canada SIGINT relationship dates back to an alliance formed during World War II. In 1949, the relationship was formalized under the CANUSA Agreement signed with CSEC. The basic tenet of CANUSA is cooperation in all aspects of SIGINT except when considered prejudicial to the national interests of one of the parties. The formal information Assurance (IA) relationship with CSEC is based on a 1986 Memorandum of Agreement. NSA has a close, cooperative relationship with CSEC that both sides would like to see expanded and strengthened.
(S//REL TO USA, CAN)) CSEC is a highly valued second party partner. The relationship is driven by our mutual interest in the defense of North America as a whole. Cooperative efforts include the exchange of liaison officers and integrees, joint projects, shared activities and a strong desire for closer collaboration in the area of cyber defense. Since Canada has a limited ability to produce cryptographic devices, it is a large consumer of U.S. IA products.
