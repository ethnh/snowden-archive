28. (S//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Am I familiar with reverse targeting procedures in order to prevent reverse targeting?
29. (S//REL TO USA, FVEY) Highlights of Targeting and Minimization Procedures
30. (S//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Do I have a reasonable belief that the target is outside the United States?
31. (U//FOUO) Analyst has an obligation to continually verify the location of the target verify and re-verify
particular type of targeting and be familiar with them. Those are the rules of the road that the court and the AG and the DNI and our office and SIGINT Director and everybody else expect you to understand. What else do you need to do?

## (S//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Know Reverse Targeting Issues

(S//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) The last thing is you have got to be familiar with is the reverse targeting procedures. Congress is very concerned that if they made it easier for the Intelligence Community to target people reasonably believed to be outside of the United States, we'd turn right around and use that as a means of targeting people who are inside the United States but communicate with them. So be familiar with the procedures that govern that and prevent that from happening.

## (S//REL TO USA, FVEY) Highlights of Targeting and Minimization Procedures

(S//REL TO USA, FVEY) Now, the good news for you all is that I'm not going to sit down in front of you all and read a set of minimization procedures to you. You should read them and be familiar with them; I instead am going to go through the highlights that you need to be familiar with, which I've already said. Highlights of the targeting procedures as well as the minimization procedures...

## (S//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Verify and re-verify your Target's Status and Location

(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) The first thing: targeting. You have to verify your target's status as a non-US person and their location. At all times, you have to do it initially. Do you have a reasonable belief that your target is a non-US person outside the United States? And you have to do it always. Some things can change. People move around. They move into and out of the United States. The reason we have this continuing obligation - this is why we have post- targeting analysis done by a lot of NSA people who look at things like HLR and VLR registrations of phones. If, all of the sudden, a phone that you're targeting registers in a cell inside the United States, you no longer have a reasonable belief your target is outside of the United States. So there are a lot of things like that done - IP [Internet Protocol] look-ups done for collection of email addresses.... that sort of thing. These tools are all there to help you - these organizations are there to help you - but in the end, the responsibility remains with the analyst. Things get through filters;
