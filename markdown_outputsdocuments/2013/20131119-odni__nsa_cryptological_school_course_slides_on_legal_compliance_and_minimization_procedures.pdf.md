# Sharing of SIGINT 

In this age of data and information sharing, we must remain mindful of the current regulations that prohibit the casual sharing of SIGINT.

E.O. 12333 , section 2.3 specifically addresses this.
# Targeting for Personal Purposes 

If you know someone is using the SIGINT system for personal purposes, YOU have the responsibility to report the activity.
# Auditing Requirements 

## USSID CR1610 Annex A details

auditing requirements for certain raw SIGINT systems. This auditing meets Department of Justice mandates for NSA's operations.
# Derivative Databases 

If data is saved into another file or database, that derivative database must have the same access, auditing and retention issues that the originating database held
# Access and Retention USSTD SP0018, Section 6 

## 5Years on-line

Up to 10 years off-line-request for historical searches made to OIPR
Some retention exceptions
Recognizes intrusiveness of SIGINT
FISA Data: Depends upon nature of data -check USSTD SP0018, Annex A, and/or call SV
![img-12.jpeg](img-12.jpeg)
# Therefore, accesses must be re-justified if: 

1. You Change Offices or Mission
2. You Change Locations
3. You Change Auditors
4. Your Account Lapses Due to Inactivity for 90 days

(U//FOUO) How do we protect ourselves?

The best way to protect ourselves and our SIGINT is to play by the rules.

No matter how inconvenient the rules may seem, if we fail to adhere to them, the next set of rules will be far stricter.
# (U//FOtJO) There are very few 

things we cannot accomplish within the existing rules, using the authorities we have and those authorities we can receive.
# (U//FOUO) Each phase of Production 

(collection, processing, retention, and dissemination) must be:

Accountable Defensible
Repeatable
Retrievable
(C/ (Violations of authorities must be reported:

1 at the time of recognition to SID O\&C
2. as part of the E.O. 12333 quarterly report to the IG
(U//FOUO) If you determine that you have made a targeting mistake:
Stop the query as soon as possible
2. Notify your auditor
(S//SII/ ) Anyone using NSA SIGINT databases must abide by the same rule and authorities as NSA.

Access to these databases is restricted to persons operating under DIRNSA authority.
(C//
In addition to having a National Foreign Intelligence purpose (which includes FI, Counter-intelligence and Support to Military Operations), the following general rules apply:
# (C// ) Additional authority is required to target: 

- U.S. persons (anywhere) or people within U.S. territory
(C/)

What is a Second Party Person?
In general terms, we apply the same basic definitions of a Second Party person as we apply for U.S. people.
U.S. Identities in SIGINT, Section 9 contains full definitions of each Second Party person.
