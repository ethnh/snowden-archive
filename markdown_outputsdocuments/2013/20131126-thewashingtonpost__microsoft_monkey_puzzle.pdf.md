I can answer this
... MP does not reject selectors based on their realm (is wrong here). MP will accept any targeting into its pool as long as it passes the policy and legality checks, aka front door rules. These do not test the selector value or its realm. However, MP (v6) will not deploy any targeting for realms other than emailAddr, google, msnpassport and yahoo. So for the unsupported realms, UTT should still be getting an Added or Updated targeting action response from MP (implying the targeting is in the pool), but an empty targeting summary since it did not go anywhere....

NSA could send us whatever realms they like right now, but the targeting just won't go anywhere unless it's of one of the above 4 realms. I hope they don't as we've not sized our database to cater for all it...

Hone this all makes sense...
