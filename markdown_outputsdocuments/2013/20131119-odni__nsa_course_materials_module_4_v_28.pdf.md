(TSMSUNNF) (OGC Attorney): During this part of our trip we will identify the limitations regarding access, sharing, disseminating, and retaining of $B R$ and PR/TT query results.
(U) This module will enable you to:

- (TSMSUNNF) Distinguish between the analysts authorized to query BR and PR/TT metadata and those authorized to view query results
- (TSMSUNNF) Recognize the contact chaining restrictions for RAS-approved identifiers
- (TSMSUNNF) Recognize what constitutes unique BR and PR/TT query results
- (TSMSUNNF) Identify limitations that impact the access, sharing, dissemination, and retention of BR and PR/TT query results
- (TSMSUNNF) Recognize the BR and PR/TT dissemination tracking requirement and the additional CT nexus requirement for U.S. person identifiers
(TSMSUNNF) If you are a technical person, you might be asking yourself if this information is directly applicable to you and your team. Compliance with the FISC Orders could be jeopardized by inadvertent or unintended changes in the infrastructure maintained by technical personnel. Therefore, an understanding of the requirements outlined in the Orders is important in the event that any technical support functions (data access, presentation, underlying system support - both hardware and software, etc.) cause changes to the support infrastructure that would bring NSA's compliance with the BR and PR/TT Court Orders into question.

(TS/J/SI/INF) (SV Character): Access to BR and PR/TT raw metadata and query results is restricted to those who have the required training and appropriate credentials. The Office of the Director of Compliance (ODOC) through the Signals Intelligence Directorate's Office of Oversight and Compliance (SV) controls access to the BR and PR/TT FISA metadata, ensuring that only those who have completed all of the required training and have been granted the appropriate credentials are permitted to touch the metadata.
(TS/J/SI/INF) Within the analyst workforce, a distinction is made between individuals who are permitted to query the data and those who are permitted only to view the query results. Individuals who are authorized to query BR and PR/TT metadata sets have a 100000 credentials. Division level management within a production center determines when query permissions will be granted to analysts based on a mission need, not solely on completion of BR and PR/TT FISA Training. Some technical personnel may also require query access, but their queries are for the purposes of data accuracy and integrity, not for target or intelligence analysis. Managers of technical personnel who require query permissions will make the determination in concert with their organization's compliance office, usually either SV or TV (the Technology Directorate's office of compliance).

| (TSI/SI/INF) (SV Character): The BR and PR/TT Court Orders require that an auditable record be generated whenever metadata is queried for intelligence analysis purposes. When th row OR and PR/TT metadata is queried in $\square$ an automatic audit log is generated to enable appropriate oversight of these Authorities. SV audits queries performed by both analysts and technical personnel and reviews the following on a periodic basis: <br> - Query requests <br> - User login <br> - Internet Protocol (IP) address <br> - Date and time of the access |  |  |  |  |  |
| (TSI/SI/INF) (HMC Character): While these audits are one way to verify that only RAS-approved identifiers are used as seeds to query the BR and PR/TT metadata, the analytic tool used to query this metadata, employs an Emphatic Access Restriction (EAR) software to provide reasonable assurance that only RAS-approved identifiers are queried by analysts. While the EAR is of great benefit for analysts, it should not lessen awareness and attention to detail while using the NSA tools and applications associated with BR and PR/TT. We'll discuss the EAR in greater detail later in this module. |  |  |  |  |  |

| (TS//SU/NF) (OGC Attorney): Another aspect of data access and governance is the requirement for the sourcing of BR and PR/TT metadata records. As we mentioned in Module 2, the metadata must carry unique markings, or tags. These tags allow the analyst to determine if a particular piece of information is derived from either the BR or PR/TT repository. In addition, these markings enable the EAR software and other management controls to function properly. |  |  |  |  |  |

Question 1. (TS/SS/INF) Correct! a), b), and c) describe individuals and groups holding a co-worker with redentials.
(TS/SS/INF) Incorrect. Positional authority does not supersede the requirement to have these specific credentials. Not all managers or SV personnel may require these credentials for their specific jobs. The correct answers are a), b), and c).

Question 2. (TS/SS/INF) Correct! Before you share any BR or PR/TT query results with a co-worker, you must first verify that he or she has the proper credentials to have access to BR and PR/TT information.
(TS/SS/INF) Incorrect, The answer is c). Before you share any BR or PR/TT query results with a co-worker, you must first verify that he or she has the proper credentials to have access to BR and PR/TT information.

(TS/JSI/NF) (HMC Character): Once you are operating within the BR or PR/TT mode of remember that you may only use a RAS-approved identifier to query the metadata. A RAS-approved identifier that is used to initiate a query of BR or PR/TT metadata is referred to as a "seed" since it is being used to produce a "chain" of metadata contacts, known as contact chaining.
(TS/JSI/NF) (HMC) employs the EAR software to provide reasonable assurance that only RAS-approved identifiers are queried by analysts. Before executing a query on an identifier, the EAR verifies that the identifier is RAS-approved. If an analyst attempts to query a non-RAS-approved identifier while still in BR or PR/TT query mode, the EAR will provide reasonable assurance that no results are returned for that query; this includes data not derived from BR or PR/TT. This query will, however, be reflected in $\& V$ 's auditing and a justification for the query attempt may be requested. If you are unsure whether an identifier is RAS-approved, use to determine the identifier's approval status.

Under PR/TT, the FI\&C limits the number of hops for internet communications to only two, and the hop counter will not permit these FI\&Cmandated levels to be exceeded |  |  |  |  |  |

(TSI/SII/NF) (HMC Character): Once the EAR verifies that the seed that the analyst has requested to querv is RAG approved, it will allow the analyst to
"chain" on that identifier. In the BR and PR/TT Orders, the FISC sets limits on how extensive this chaining may be. We refer to this as the number of hops from a RAS-approved identifier. For example, let's say your target calls an associate $00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

(TSI/SII/NF) Since it is possible that one communication event will be collected under multiple collection authorities (and multiple collection sources), not all of the results will be unique to one collection authority (or collection source). Keep in mind that the classification at the beginning of each result only indicates the highest level classification of that result, and does not necessarily reflect whether a result was unique to one collection authority (or collection

(TS/J/SI/INF) (HMC Character): In the examples we just discussed, none of the results were unique to any one collection authority. Frequently, however, you'll find that some of the results within the chain are unique to one particular collection authority. A BR- or PR/TT-unique query result is any piece of information that N\&A would not have had but for the BR or PR/TT metadata from which it was drawn. In other words, BR or PR/TT was the ONLY source of that individual contact/query result.
(TS/J/SI/INF) Here are some examples: example A is "E.O. 12333-unique," while B is "PR/TT-unique," and C is "BR-unique. $\square$
(TS/J/SI/INF) \&haring restrictions in the FI\&C Orders only apply to unique BR or PR/TT query results. If query results are derived from multiple sources are are not unique to BR and PR/TT alone, the rules governing the other collection authority would apply. We will discuss these sharing and handling restrictions in greater depth shortly.

Comment [x12]: Again show previous examples.
Comment [SLS13]: Note for audio recording: we will want some time in between saying example A is "E.O. 12333-unique," and while B is "PR/TT-unique," and and C is "BR-unique." to allow learner to look at the examples. Please allow some "quiet" space that can be duplicated to the amount of time needed. THANKS!

(TSMSWNF) (OGC Attorney): Before we discuss sharing and handling restrictions of BR- and PR/TT-unique query results, it is important to understand that a BR or PR/TT query result is not just a line within the chain that is presented to you after you run a BR or PR/TT query in $\square$ Any information that you derive, extract, or manipulate from that particular line in the chain becomes a BR or PR/TT result. Given that a source of the result is derived from BR or PR/TT metadata, any adaptation of that result, including information provided orally or in writing, even a tip or a lead, remains a BR or PR/TT query result.
(TSMSWNF) (OGC Attorney): In addition, other examples of items that have been deemed to be BR and PR/TT query results include:

- A specific identifier
- "Identifier A was in contact with Identifier B"
- A $\square$ line (for example the entire contact chain/result set) that contains BR or PR/TT query results
- A written or electronic depiction of a chain (like the $\square$ line itself) or the analysis or partial analysis of a chain that includes BR or PR/TT results
- A compilation or summary of first- and second-level contacts of a RAS-approved seed
- A draft or a finished but not yet disseminated report
- Any other BR or PR/TT information returned following a RAS-approved federated query

(TSI/SI/INF) (HMC Character): So, for example, if you run a BR or PR/TT query on a particular RAG-approved e-mail identifier and it returns information that depicts identifier $A$, the RAG-approved seed, was in direct contact with identifier $B$ and the source of the metadata is BR or PR/TT, then just the fact that identifier $A$ is communicating with identifier $B$ is considered a $B R$ or $P R / T T$ query result.
(TSI/SI/INF) (HMC Character): In addition, any summary of that information would also be a BR or PR/TT query result. So, if you knew that identifier A belonged to Joe and identifier B belonged to Sam, and the fact of that contact was derived from BR or PR/TT metadata, if you communicate orally or in writing that Joe talked to Sam, even if you don't include the actual e-mail account or telephone numbers that were used to communicate, this is still a BR or PR/TT query result.
(TSI/SI/INF) (OGC Attorney): Remember, if these results are determined to be BR- or PR/TT-UNIQUE, they are subject to sharing and handling restrictions.

(TS/JSI/INF) (OGC Attorney): Remember, BR- or PR/TT-unique query results are those contacts within a chain solely derived from the BR or PR/TT metadata and not duplicated in the results originating from any other authorities. Any oral or written depiction, manipulation, or summary containing that information is also a unique query result. Until they are officially disseminated, BR- or PR/TT-unique results may only be shared with individuals who hold the proper credentials to receive or view BR or PR/TT information. The requirement is imposed because of the special handling restrictions that we will discuss later in this Module. Without the proper training, the FISC-imposed handling restrictions may not be followed.
(TS/JSI/INF) (HMC Character) Unless these unique results have been disseminated, such BR- or PR/TT-unique information may only be shared with individuals who have the proper credentials to receive or view BR or PR/TT information. Remember, use to determine a user's credentials. This means

- Any document, or other file containing BR- or PR/TT-unique information may only be stored on the analyst's personal folders, or an access-

controlled, shared location that is accessible to only BR and PR/TT cleared personnel.

- Query results cannot be put into any system where the results would be shared with individuals without
- BR- or PR/TT-unique results may not be queried in tools where user queries are visible to other analysts (who may not have
or can be manipulated by behind the scenes analytics. If you have questions regarding which tools are acceptable to further research query results, please contact your management or technical director.
(TS/SSWNF) (SV Character) However, as we've discussed, not all BR or PR/TT results are unique. If a query result indicates it was derived from another collection source in addition to BR or PR/TT, the rules governing the other collection authority would apply to the handling and sharing of that query result. For example, this result came from both BR and E.O. 12333 collection; therefore, because it is not unique to BR information, it would be ok to inform nonBR cleared individuals of the fact of this communication, as well as task, query, and report this information according to standard E.O. 12333 guidelines.
(TS/SSWNF) (SV Character) In summary, if a query result has multiple collection authorities, analysts should source and/or report the non-BR or PR/TT version of that query result according to the rules governing the other authority. But if it is unique to either the BR or PR/TT authority then it is a unique query result with all of the applicable BR and PR/TT restrictions placed on it. In both cases, however, analysts should not share the actual chain containing BR or PR/TT results with analysts who do not have the credentials to receive or view BR or PR/TT information. In such an instance, if it is necessary to share the chain, analysts should re-run the query in the non-BR or non-PR/TT areas of and share that .cml.

(TS/J/SI/NF) (OGC Attorney): First of all, every disseminated report from NSA must include sourcing information so that we know where the information came from, as well as follow all USSID SP0018 minimization requirements and procedures. For BR- and PR/TT-derived information, the analyst or report needs to make sure that the information included in that report is properly sourced to the appropriate BR or PR/TT authority.
(TS/J/SI/NF) In addition, the Court Orders for both the BR and PR/TT authorities have imposed two unique, stringent requirements with respect to disseminating information from these authorities. The first is the Counterterrorism, or CT, nexus requirement, and the second is the dissemination tracking requirement.

| (TS/SS/INF) (OGC Attorney): The CT nexus requirement applies only to U.S. person information. If you run a query and the information returned is all foreign person information, then the CT nexus requirement does not apply to this situation. However, if your query results include U.S. person information derived from BR or PR/TT and you want to disseminate that information to an external customer, such as the FBI, then this requirement must be met prior to dissemination, in any form. Traditionally, under US\$ID SPO018, if there is a piece of unminimized U.S. person information that you would like to disseminate, one of the designated approval authorities (to be covered on the next screen) needs to determine that the information is necessary to understand the foreign intelligence in that particular intelligence report before the information can be released. For BR and PR/TT, the requirement is slightly different. | Comment [SLS19]: 1PT/ATR 7/13/11 from the SMRV. Planes resed or 17/9/11 18 is/1/10100 1997. |

[^0]
[^0]:    (TSMSWNF) (HMC Character). It might seem as though the information would most certainly be counterterrorism-related since, due to the RAS approval process, you wouldn't have this U.S. person information from a query of BR or PR/TT if it weren't related to counterterrorism. In the majority of cases, it will be counterterrorism-related; however, the nature of the counterterrorism target is that it often overlaps with several other areas that include counternarcotics, counterintelligence, money laundering, document forging, people and weapons trafficking, and other topics that are not CT-centric. Thus, due to the fact that these authorities provide NSA access to a high volume of U.S. person information for counterterrorism purposes, the Court Order requires an explicit finding that the information is in fact related to counterterrorism prior to dissemination. Therefore, one of the approved decision makers must document the finding using the proper terminology. It must state that the information is related to counterterrorism and that it is necessary to understand the counterterrorism information.
    (TSMSWNF)-(OGC Attorney). While the USSID SP0018 process is the most familiar method of governing the dissemination of unminimized U.S. person information obtained from traditional SIGINT means, the CT nexus requirement is an additional protection for U.S. person information being disseminated when the BR or PR/TT authorities, and metadata obtained by virtue of those authorities, is the source of the information. The FISC wants to ensure that the authorities are being used for counterterrorism purposes as intended, so consider the CT nexus requirement a step above justifying a foreign intelligence requirement.

(TSMSWNF) (OGC Attorney): It is important to note that the authority to approve the dissemination of U.S. person information cannot be delegated. This responsibility is assigned only to the positions named in the BR and PR/TT Court Orders. Let's say, for example, that the Chief and Deputy Chief of Information Sharing Services Office, the two individuals who on a normal daily basis would be making the decision, are both on vacation on the same day. In this instance, someone else within their office may be the acting chief on that day; however, the acting chief cannot make the decision to disseminate U.S. person information.
(TSMSWNF) (HMC Character): Under these circumstances, if information about a U.S. person must be disseminated on that day, then you should send your dissemination request to one of the other positions named in the Orders. This would logically be the NSOC SOO.

| (TS/ISW/NF) (OGC Attorney): The other requirement, which applies to both U.S. person information as well as foreign person information, is the dissemination tracking requirement regarding the dissemination of BR- and PR/TT-derived information.
