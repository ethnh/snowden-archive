## ORIGINAL CLASSIFICATION AUTHORITY:

1. (TS//SI//REL) Project BULLRUN deals with NSA's abilities to defeat the encryption used in specific network communication technologies. BULLRUN involves multiple sources, all of which are extremely sensitive. They include CNE, interdiction, industry relationships, collaboration with other IC entities, and advanced mathematical techniques. Several ECIs apply to the specific sources, methods, and techniques involved. Because of the multiple sources involved in BULLRUN activities, "capabilities against a technology" does not necessarily equate to decryption.
2. (U//FOUO) The BULLRUN data label (for use in databases) and marking (for use in hard- or softcopy documents) are for internal NSA/CSS use only. It will appear in the classification line and corresponding portion markings after all applicable ODNIapproved markings are in place. The format is:
Classification//SCI Control System Markings//CAPCO-approved Dissemination Control Markings/BULLRUN. Examples include:

- TOP SECRET//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY/BULLRUN
- TOP SECRET//SI-ECI PIQ//ORCON/NOFORN/BULLRUN

3. (U//FOUO) Appendix A lists specific BULLRUN capabilities. Details may be protected by one or more ECI. Contact CES CAO for access to the appendix or further guidance.

(U) 25 years*: Declassification in 25 years indicates that the information is classified for 25 years from the date a document is created or 25 years from the date of this original classification decision, whichever is later.

## (U) ACRONYMS/DEFINITIONS:

(U) Capabilities - For the purposes of this classification guide, the NSA/CSS ability to exploit a specific technology. This may encompass acquiring and processing plaintext data and/or acquiring, decrypting and processing encrypted data.
(U) HTTPS - HTTP traffic secured inside an SSL/TLS session, indicated by the https:// URL, commonly using TCP port 443
(U) IPSEC -- IPSec, or IP Security, is the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standard for layer 3 real-time communication security. IPSec allows two hosts (or two gateways) to establish a secure connection, sometimes called a tunnel. All traffic is protected at the network layer. (IETF is the Internet Engineering Task Force, a loosely self-organized group of people who contribute to the engineering and evolution of Internet technologies. It is the principal body engaged in the development of new Internet standard specifications.)
# TOP SECRET//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY 

(U) PPTP - Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol is a method for implementing virtual private networks. The PPTP specification does not describe encryption or authentication features and relies on the protocol being tunneled to implement security functionality.
(U) SSH - Secure Shell. A common protocol used for secure remote computer access
(U) SSL - Secure Sockets Layer. Commonly used to provide secure network communication. Widely used on the internet to provide secure web browsing, webmail, instant messaging, electronic commerce, etc.
(U) TLS - Transport Layer Security. The follow-on to SSL, SSLv3 and TLSv1.0 are nearly identical.
(U) VoIP - Voice over Internet Protocol. A general term for the using IP networks to make voice phone calls. The application layer protocol can be standards-based (e.g., H.323, SIP), or proprietary (e.g., Skype).
(U) VPN - Virtual Private Network. A private network that makes use of the public telecommunications infrastructure, maintaining privacy via the use of a tunneling protocol and security procedures that typically include encryption. Common protocols include IPSEC and PPTP.
