(S) PREAMBLE: In 1968 President Johnson and Prime Minister Eshkol agreed that an intelligence exchange would take place between the United States and Israel. This understanding resulted in an intelligence exchange arrangement between the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), Department of Defense (DoD) and the Directorate of Military Intelligence (DMI), Israel Defense Forces (IDF), known as the CYR Agreement. In 1988 the CYR Agreement was adjusted, broadened, reinforced, and extended and the new Agreement was named \"ICE CASTLE\". In 1996, the agreement was updated and renamed \"STONE RUBY.\"\n\nOver the years the scope of the intelligence exchange developed both in substance and in depth, contributing significantly to the national security of the U.S. and Israel.\n\nThis revised Agreement gives expression to the developments in the intelligence exchange relationship that have occurred since its inception, and provides the means and procedures for the continuation and enhancement of that exchange for the mutual benefit of both countries.\n\nAll exchanges of military intelligence whether by meeting, conference, ad hoc gatherings, or via any communications medium between any DoD organization and any IDF organization, shall be conducted under the auspices of this Agreement and shall be subject to the policies and procedures contained herein. Exchanges between DoD and IDF organizations involving only signals intelligence have been upgraded to the TOP SECRET level. All other intelligence exchanged will be at the SECRET level and below. DIA and the DMI, as the parties to this Agreement, represent DoD and the IDF, respectively, in carrying out its provisions.\n\nThis Agreement supersedes the STONE RUBY Memorandum of Agreement dated 19 August 1955.\n2.
