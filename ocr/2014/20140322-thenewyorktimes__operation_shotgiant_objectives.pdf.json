This was all stated in the National Intelligence Estimate that came out a few months ago: \"the increasing role of international companies and foreign individuals in US information technology supply chains and services will increase the potential for persistent, stealthy subversions.\"","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":1653,"width":2339}},{"index":1,"markdown":"So to recap, this is what we are hoping to accomplish:\nTS/ISI/REL) Determine if Huawei is doing SIGINT for PRC.\n(TS/ISI/REL) Perform more analysis on Huawei Corp - define relationships, organization, plans, etc.\n(TS/ISI/REL) Direct efforts against intelligence gaps - IRM deorypts, underwater fiber, R \\& D facilities, follow the money, supply chain, etc.\n(TS/ISI/REL) Focus on high priority targets - Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Kenya, Cuba.\n(TS/ISI/REL) Leverage Huawei presence to gain access to networks of interest.\n(TS/ISI/REL) Document processes to be used later for targeting other non-partnerable companies.\nHow is success defined?

The first step was to form a TOPI, so that we can start to report some of our findings and continue tasking the communications. However, targeting Huawei is a big, messy task. In order to help us focus, we broke Huawei into three pillars: The Company, The Technology, The Deployment of the Technology.\nWhen we look at these three different aspects of Huawei we found that two topics showed up across the board-marketing and plans/intentions. So that is our main focus. If we can see how Huawei is marketing itself, and working to expand this will help us to understand the company's plans and intentions. If we can determine the company's plans and intentions, we hope that this will lead us back to plans and intentions of the PRC.\n\nWe will consider ourselves a success if we\nObtaining actionable intelligence of Huawei's (and potentially PRC's) leadership plans and intentions\nEnable SIGINT collection through CNE tools","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":1964,"width":2778}}],"model":"mistral-ocr-2503-completion","usage_info":{"pages_processed":2,"doc_size_bytes":393731}}
