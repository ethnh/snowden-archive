This guide addresses information associated with STELLARWIND and associated classification instructions, while classification guidance associated with FISA information can be found, in one location, in an NSA/CSS FISA/Protect America Act (PAA)/FISA Amendments Act (FAA) classification guide authored by NSA SID Oversight and Compliance (SV). Consequently, this document will reference an NSA/CSS FISA/PAA/FAA classification guidance where information formerly associated with STELLARWIND is now authorized by the FISC. Also, this document references classification guidelines for FISA/PAA/FAA information and within Exceptionally Controlled Information (ECI) compartments within NSA where necessary. Users should reference both guides to determine proper classification. Additional Annexes are provided as additional information to assist the users of this guide.\n(TS//SI//NF) The markings \"TSP\" and \"Compartmented\" were at times used in briefing materials and documentation associated with the STELLARWIND program. \"TSP\" and \"Compartmented\" were used primarily by the National Security Agency (NSA) Legislative Affairs Office (LAO), NSA Office of General Counsel (OGC), and the Executive Branch in briefings and declarations intended for external audiences, such as Congress and the courts. The term \"TSP\" was initially used in relation to only that portion of the Program that was publicly disclosed by the\n\n## TOP SECRET//SI//ORCON/NOFORN","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":1700,"width":2200}},{"index":2,"markdown":"# TOP SECRET//SI//ORCON/NOFORN \n\nPresident in December 2005.
