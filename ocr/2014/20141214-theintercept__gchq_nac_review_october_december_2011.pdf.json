{"pages":[{"index":0,"markdown":"CNE Access to BELGACOM GRX Operator: (GREEN) This work has been very successful and has enabled not only CNE but also Crypt Ops by identifying a large number of VPN exploitation opportunities. The NAC held a joint MyNOC with Crypt Ops (OP SOCIALIST II) to identify the huge extent of opportunity that this work has identified. Work continues on a reduced number of CNE requirements.\n\nMERION ZETA (support for NEP and Crypt Ops teams): This surge - which included contributors from other areas - was a continuation of the NAC's involvement in the project to exploit Belgacom's GRX network, as required by the Mobile Theme. This particular surge, which was completed successfully, included efforts to: identify the mobile network operators that connect to the Belgacom network via VPN; characterise each VPN and determine those that contain GTP: facilitate the processing of these GTP events to enable the extraction and use of target selectors; conduct access analysis to identify the best point of access for the key networks; make recommendations for further sustained GTP processing.\n\n- Successful VERACIOUS Project-enabling conducted; key requirements for upcoming work identified, which are key to reducing risk exposure. Network Analysis on BELGACOM hugely successful enabling exploitation.","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2200,"width":1700}}],"model":"mistral-ocr-2503-completion","usage_info":{"pages_processed":1,"doc_size_bytes":82908}}
