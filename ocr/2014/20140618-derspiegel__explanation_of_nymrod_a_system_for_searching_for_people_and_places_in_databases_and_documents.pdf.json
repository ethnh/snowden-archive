The NYMROD system was invented to help","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2600,"width":1700}},{"index":1,"markdown":"with just that problem. The NYMROD name-matching system, developed by the Center for Content Extraction (CCE), can accept gueries consisting of personal names, perform a \"fuzzy\" match of the input name to one or more sets of stored names, and return a list of potential matches for presentation to the user. NYMROD finds potential name matches without wildcards and can match across scripts (for example, between Arabic and Roman scripts).\n(S//SI//REL) NYMROD's first sets of names stored for matching have all been taken from intelligence reports from NSA, CIA, and DoD databases, with CREST (transcript database) names coming on-line soon. Since its initial release in January 2008, analysts have been using NYMROD to find information relating to targets that would otherwise be tough to track down. The user interface is very simple: you just type in the name you are looking for, set a matching threshold from 0.1 (very tolerant of differences) to 1.0 (exact match), select the datase(s) you want to search within, and submit the guery. The results presentation will allow you to browse the snippets of text that contained the matched name. You can try out this capability for yourself if you \"go NYMROD\" in your web browser.\n(S//SI//REL) \"But I don't want yet another tool!\", many of you have said, and the CCE has taken this to heart. NYMROD also offers a web service that other systems can use to create their own datasets and perform matching gueries. We are working with partners such as the Target Knowledge Base, the Unified Targeting Tool, and FASTSCOPE to begin integrating the service into those systems so that its operation is available to their users without anyone having to leave their normal work environment. Developers can find more information about NYMROD's web service, including an Interface Control Document, on the CCE's documentation web page.\n(U//FOUO) NYMROD's performance is monitored using a guality-assurance process. We work closely with our commercial and R6 technology suppliers to continuously improve the underlying matching software so that we can offer performance enhancements with each quarterly release of NYMROD. Our April 2008 release made large strides in performance on Arabic names, while the upcoming release in July will offer greatly improved Chinese name matching.
