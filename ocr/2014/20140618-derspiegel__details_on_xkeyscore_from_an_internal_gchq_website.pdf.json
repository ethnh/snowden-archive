If you can't log on or use the tool during this period, its because of this.\n\n## [edit] Guidance on microplugins\n\nAs you know, you can create microplugins to do different things: some perform advanced detection techniques to find types of traffic which can't be detected by keywords or regular expressions alone. Others identify and extract data fields into XKS's\n\nQuick Links\n\n- XKEYSCORE Main Page\n- XKS \\& scale on SSE\n- Getting Sreme-Selected Content into XKS\n- Getting an XKS Account\n- Using XKEYSCORE\n- XKEYSCORE Training\n- XKEYSCORE Development\n- XKEYSCORE Contracts\n- XKS News Archive\n- XKS Requirements\n- XKS Searches user guide\n- XKS Results user guide\n- XKS Approval process\n- NFV in XKS\n- Promotion from XKS\n- Automatic Promotion from XKS\n- XKS for CNE\n- NSA XKeyscore Using XKS for CNE\n- XKS Tech Dictionaries\n\nUseful Links\n\n- Mastering The Internet\n- Transforming Analysis\n- TINT\n- CTE\n- SD Home\n\nUseful Links\n\n- NSA XKeyscore Using XKS for CNE\n- XKS Tech Dictionaries\n\nUseful Links\n\n- Mastering The Internet\n- Transforming Analysis\n- TINT\n- CTE\n- SD Home","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2600,"width":1700}},{"index":1,"markdown":"metadata table to ensure they meet UK legal and policy requirements.\nPlease also be aware that usually microplugins are automatically shared with at least NSA and may also get deployed to other 2 P XKS. By mid-2011 a new version of XKS should have been deployed where individual microplugins will still be deployed to every XKS, but they can be tagged not to run on certain XKS. The only exception is where you deploy a microplugin only to GTE's XKS fleet: these will not be visible to 2 P partners.\n\n# [edit] Types of XKEYSCORE \n\nThere are currently three different types of XKS:\n\n- Traditional\n- Stage 2\n- Deep Dive\n\nThey differ principally on where in the processing chain they sit, whether the data they receive has already been sessionised or not and whether they ingest all of the data they receive or whether they apply rules to only ingest some data.\n\n## Iedit1 Traditional\n\nWhen XKS was first developed it was used to receive data from low data rate signals being processed through WEALTHYCLUSTER (WC). WC sessionised all the data on the link and presented it all to XKS. All data was ingested into XKS.\n\nGCHQ has traditional XKS at many of our sites, including all of our Comsat, Terrestrial and SMO sites. The EREPO XKS is also a traditional XKS, though in that case data has been softly selected at the implant and sessionisation takes place in TERRAIN, rather than WC.\n\n## Iedit1 Stage 2\n\nFor higher data rates, a \"Stage 2\" XKS was developed to ingest data from TURMOIL. TURMOIL passes $5 \\%$ of the packets to XKS which XKS then sessionizes. TURMOIL decides which $5 \\%$ of packets to pass based on the following criteria:\n\n- strong selection\n- subnet promotion\n- technology promotion\n- e-mail domains\n- persona session promotion (where if a strong selector is seen, 10 minutes' or 10 MB of data is collected)\n- persona session collection (where the data is collected and forwarded to NSAs PINWALE but is also passed to the XKS)\n\nThis data is then sent to the Stage 2 XKS. All other data is lost.\nOnly JPC (MUSCULAR) at GCHQ uses a Stage 2 XKS.\n\n## Iedit1 Deep Dive\n\nDeep Dive XKS was developed to prove that sessionisation at 10G data rates was possible. First it sessionises all data on a link. Then it promotes data using the GENESIS selection language to identify data types where we assess there is potential intelligence value and ingests those. The promotion process can make one of three decisions:\n\n- Block data that is legally not allowed to be in the system - ie UK-UK traffic\n- Allow data that is known to be wanted through use of promotion rules\n- And then to drop any data that doesn't meet either of these\n\nOne of the experiments in TINT is seeking to identify where the best balance lies between what is kept and what is not. A factor in deciding how much data to keep is the scale of storage capacity that can be provided.\n\nGCHQ already operates a number of Deep Dive XKS:","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2600,"width":1700}},{"index":2,"markdown":"3 of 4","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2600,"width":1700}}],"model":"mistral-ocr-2503-completion","usage_info":{"pages_processed":3,"doc_size_bytes":423576}}
