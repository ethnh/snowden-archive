There has been a topic of conversation that has started to rumble beneath the surface of the Cyber-scene lately, it's about router hacking(for this post I'm not talking about your home ADSL router, I'm talking about bigger routers. such as Ciscos/Junipers iHuaweis used by ISPs for their infrastructure). Hacking routers has been good business for us and our 5-eyes partners for some time now, but it is becoming more apparent that other nation states are honing their skillz and joining the scene. Before I get into it too much, let's go over some of the things that someone could do if they hack a router:\n\n* You could add credentials, allowing yourself to log in any time you choose.\n* You could add/change routing rules.\n* You could set up a packet capture capability...imagine running Wireshark on an ISP's infrastructure router...like a local listening post for any credentials being passed over the wire(!)\n* You could weaken any VPN encryption capabilities on the router, forcing it to create easily decryptable tunnels.\n* You could install a dorked version of the Operating System with whatever functionality you want pre-built in","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":1700,"width":2800}}],"model":"mistral-ocr-2503-completion","usage_info":{"pages_processed":1,"doc_size_bytes":23078}}
