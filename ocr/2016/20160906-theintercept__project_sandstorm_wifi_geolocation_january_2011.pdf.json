Testing is underway at MHS to improve techniques for characterisation of wi-fi devices in dider that collectors such as OH may geolocate.\n- Active Sigint Enabling Passive Geolocation (ASEPG). The programme is a set of solutions that exploit 802.11 wireless services allowing Overhead to geolocate high value targets in denied areas while they are off the net. Geolocations of under 100 m are expected against low power signals.","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":462,"width":1648}}],"model":"mistral-ocr-2503-completion","usage_info":{"pages_processed":1,"doc_size_bytes":19976}}
