In November 2012, a French magazine revealed information about the attacks and accused the U.S. of being responsible. During a January 2013 visit, unbeknownst to FAD Desk Officers and SUSLAF, DGSE and ANSSI questioned DIRNSA about the cyber attacks and asked about U.S. involvement. DIRNSA denied U.S. involvement and offered NSA's assistance to France in attributing the attacks. Two (2) NSA CSS Threat Operations Center (NTOC) Analysts were prepared to travel to Paris in March to provide support to the French, DGSE and ANSSI canceled the meeting the day before the team was scheduled to depart and instead, requested a visit to NSA on 12 April.

There is suspicion that the information is not being shared prior to the visit because the French want to see how NSA responds when they present their findings. During the January 2013 DIRNSA visit to Paris, both DGSE and ANSSI asked GEN Alexander about the cyber attacks in an attempt to ascertain whether or not the U.S. was responsible for the attacks (as reported in French magazines). At no time was FAD made aware that DGSE and ANSSI intended to raise the issue with DIRNSA.\n\n\n## (U) OTHER INFORMATION:\n\n- (TS/SI/NF) TAO confirmed that this was not a TAO operation.

An initial press report from Paris Atlantico, \"French Website Says Turkish Hackers Behind Elysee Cyber Attacks.\" dated 12 July 2012, stated it was believed \"the attacks originated from France's allies\" and speculated Turkish hackers with possible links to Turkish \"intelligence services or government bodies\" might be responsible. No follow-on press reports have been seen that place blame on Turkey. A press report from Paris L'Express, \"French Weekly Reports on Alleged US Cyber Espionage Attack on Elysee Palace.\" dated 20 November 2012, shifted blame for the attacks toward the United States. On 27 November 2012, Qrret sur images contacted the Paris L'Express author who shared there are an \"array of assumptions\" that enable pointing to the United States as the origin of this attack. Paris L'Express contacted ANSSI and the Elysee, both declined to comment.","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2600,"width":1700}}],"model":"mistral-ocr-2503-completion","usage_info":{"pages_processed":4,"doc_size_bytes":682381}}
