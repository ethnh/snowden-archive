The few that don't involve those niche partners for whom our strategy is to simply maintain a viable relationship that we can rely on should we need it in the future. And that these are only some of the accomplishments for FY13...there are way too many to address in just an hour.\n\nWhen it comes to discussing the challenges and roadblocks that we believe are going to make it difficult if not impossible to accomplish specific items, the causative factors are divided between NSA and partner budget cuts, legal and policy impediments on the partner side, and in a few cases partner unwillingness to cooperate or meet their obligations to us.\n\n## $\\qquad$\n\n## Select Accomplishments: Production (second slide)\n\n(TS//SI//NF) Sweden: This is the DIRNSA-initiated Quantum trilat between NSA, GCHQ, and FRA. While the overall success rate has been low, the effort can be considered a success in terms of proof of concept. Continued GCHQ involvement may be in jeopardy due to British legal/policy restrictions, and in fact NSA's goal all along has been to transition this effort to a bilat with the Swedish partner.","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2200,"width":1700}}],"model":"mistral-ocr-2503-completion","usage_info":{"pages_processed":1,"doc_size_bytes":28294}}
