DEFINITIONS \n\nDL1.1.1. Administrative Purposes. Information is collected for \"administrative purposes\" when it is necessary for the administration of the component concerned, but is not collected directly in performance of the intelligence activities assigned such component. Examples include information relating to the past performance of potential contractors; information to enable such components to discharge their public affairs and legislative duties, including the maintenance of correspondence files; the maintenance of employee personnel and training records; and training materials or documents produced at training facilities.\n\nDL1.1.2. Available Publicly. Information that has been published or broadcast for general public consumption, is available on request to a member of the general public, could lawfully be seen or heard by any casual observer, or is made available at a meeting open to the general public. In this context, the \"general public\"also means general availability to persons in a military community even though the military community is not open to the civilian general public.\n\nDL1.1.3. Communications Security. Protective measures taken to deny unauthorized persons information derived from telecommunications of the U.S. Government related to national security and to ensure the authenticity of such telecommunications.\n\nDL1.1.4. Consent. The agreement by a person or organization to permit DoD intelligence components to take particular actions that affect the person or organization. Consent may be oral or written unless a specific form of consent is required by a particular procedure. Consent may be implied if adequate notice is provided that a particular action (such as entering a building) carries with it the presumption of consent to an accompanying action (such as search of briefcases).

General Rules\n\nC5.1.2.1. Electronic Surveillance Pursuant to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. A DoD intelligence component may conduct electronic surveillance within the United States for foreign intelligence and counterintelligence purposes only pursuant to an order issued by a judge of the court appointed pursuant to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (reference (b)), or pursuant to a certification of the Attorney General issued under the authority of Section 102(a) of the Act.\n\nC5.1.2.2.

PART2: ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES FOR INTELLIGENCE PURPOSES \n\nC5.2.1. Applicability. This part of Procedure 5 applies to electronic surveillance, as defined in the Definitions Section, for foreign intelligence and counterintelligence purposes directed against United States persons who are outside the United States, and who, under the circumstances, have a reasonable expectation of privacy. It is intended to be applied in conjunction with the regulation of electronic surveillance \"within the United States\" under Part 1 and the regulation of \"signals intelligence activities\" under Part 3 so that the intentional interception for foreign intelligence and counterintelligence purposes of all wire or radio communications of persons within the United States and against United States persons abroad where such persons enjoy a reasonable expectation of privacy is covered by one of the three parts. In addition, this part governs the use of electronic, mechanical, or other surveillance devices for foreign intelligence and counterintelligence purposes against a United States person abroad in circumstances where such person has a reasonable expectation of privacy. This part does not apply to the electronic surveillance of communications of other than United States persons abroad or the interception of the communications of United States persons abroad that do not constitute electronic surveillance.\n\n## C5.2.2. Explanation of Undefined Terms\n\nC5.2.2.1. Electronic surveillance is \"directed against a United States person\" when the surveillance is intentionally targeted against or designed to intercept the communications of that person. Electronic surveillance directed against persons who are not United States persons that results in the incidental acquisition of the communications of a United States person does not thereby become electronic surveillance directed against a United States person.\n\nC5.2.2.2. Electronic surveillance is \"outside the United States\" if the person against whom the electronic surveillance is directed is physically outside the United States, regardless of the location at which surveillance is conducted. For example, the interception of communications that originate and terminate outside the United States can be conducted from within the United States and still fall under this part rather than Part 1.\n\nC5.2.3.

Whether concealed monitoring is to occur where the subject has a reasonable expectation of privacy is a determination that depends upon the circumstances of a particular case, and shall be made only after consultation with the legal office responsible for advising the DoD intelligence component concerned. Reasonable expectation of privacy is the extent to which a reasonable person in the particular circumstances involved is entitled to believe his or her actions are not subject to monitoring by electronic, optical, or mechanical devices. For example, there are ordinarily reasonable expectations of privacy in work spaces if a person's actions and papers are not subject to ready observation by others under normal working conditions. Conversely, a person walking out of his or her residence into a public street ordinarily would not have a reasonable expectation that he or she is not being observed or even photographed; however, such a person ordinarily would have an expectation of privacy within his or her residence.\n\n# C6.3.

The Associate Director for Policy endorsed an administrative update, effective 27 December 2007 to make minor adjustments to the policy. This 29 May 2009 administrative update includes changes due to the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 and in core training requirements.\n(U) OPI: Office of General Counsel (OGC), 963-3121s\n(U) No section of this document, regardless of classification, shall be released without approval from the Office of Policy and Records, DJP1.\n\n# (U) POLICY \n\n1. (U) NSA/CSS shall collect, process, retain, and disseminate information about U.S. persons only as prescribed in DoD Directive 5240.1 (Reference a), DoD Regulation 5240.1-R (Reference e), orders issued by the Foreign intelligence Surveillance Court pursuant to reference b, and the Classified Annex to DoD Procedures under Executive Order 12333 (hereafter referred to as the Classified Annex; Reference f).\n\n## (U) PROCEDURES\n\n2. (U) Signals Intelligence. The signals intelligence (SIGINT) mission of the NSA/CSS is to collect, process, analyze, produce, and disseminate SIGINT information and data for foreign intelligence and counterintelligence purposes to support national and departmental missions. NSA/CSS shall intentionally collect only foreign communications. NSA/CSS shall not intentionally collect U.S. person communications without proper legal authorization. The Director, NSA/Chief, CSS (DIRNSA/CHCSS) may authorize exceptions only pursuant to the procedures contained in DoD Regulation 5240.1-R (Reference e) and the Classified Annex thereto (Reference f).\na. (U) Electronic surveillance, as defined in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, as amended (Reference b), requires a court order issued by a judge appointed pursuant to the Act or a certification of the Attorney General of the United States and the Director of National Intelligence issued pursuant to Section 105(b) of the Act. The DIRNSA/CHCSS or Deputy Director, NSA (D/DIR) must approve applications for a court order, which must be submitted through the DoD General Counsel to the Attorney General. The DIRNSA/CHCSS or D/DIR may contact the Attorney General in an emergency and the Attorney General may approve the surveillance pending subsequent court proceedings.\nb. (U) Electronic surveillance, as defined in Appendix A to DoD Regulation 5240.1-R (Reference e), directed against U.S. persons who are outside the U.S. requires an order by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Court. In emergency situations (e.g., U.S. hostages overseas), as described in Procedure 5, Part 2., of Reference e, the DIRNSA/CHCSS, D/DIR or Senior Operations Officer at the National Security Operations Center may authorize electronic surveillance, after consulting with the Office","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2200,"width":1700}},{"index":111,"markdown":"# SECRET//COMINT// \n\nof General Counsel (OGC). The Attorney General shall be notified promptly of any such surveillance.\n3. (U) Information Assurance. National Security Directive (NSD) 42 (Reference g) and Executive Order 12333 (Reference c) designated DIRNSA as the National Manager for National Security Systems (e.g. NSA's Information Assurance (IA) mission) as that term is defined by 44 U.S. C. 3542(b)(2) (Reference h). In that capacity, and pursuant to those authorities as well as other applicable laws and policies, DIRNSA's responsibilities include examining national security systems and evaluating their vulnerability to foreign interception and exploitation. NSA, as an element of the Intelligence Community and pursuant to section 2.6(c) of Executive Order 12333, as amended, may provide specialized equipment, technical knowledge, or assistance of expert personnel for use by any U.S. Government department or agency having a national security system or a non-national security system. The Executive Order directs that provision of assistance by expert personnel shall be approved in each case by the general counsel of the providing element or department. The Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (Reference i) and implementing procedures agreed to by NSA/CSS and the National Institute of Standards and Technology also authorizes NSA/CSS to provide IA support for US government non-national security systems.\na. (U) Any IA activities undertaken by NSA/CSS, including those involving monitoring of official communications, shall be conducted in strict compliance with law, Executive Order and implementing procedures, and applicable Presidential directive. Any monitoring undertaken for communications security purposes (\"COMSEC monitoring\") shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of National Telecommunications and Information Systems Security Directive (NTISSD) No. 600 (Reference j) or other special procedures approved by the Attorney General.\nb. (U) In addition to the responsibility to conduct COMSEC monitoring and to examine national security systems for vulnerabilities to foreign exploitation, NSD 42 (Reference g) also requires NSA/CSS to disseminate information on threats to national security systems, regardless of the source of the threat. Title II of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (Reference k) imposes similar requirements with respect to the protection of the United States' critical infrastructure.\nc. (U) Pursuant to NSA/CSS Policy 1-2, \"(U) Mission and Functions Statements with Service Level Agreements,\" (Reference l) and IAD's Mission and Functions Statement (Reference m), IAD performs all functions on behalf of the DIRNSA in fulfilling his role as National Manager for National Security Systems. Accordingly, the Information Assurance Director acts for DIRNSA/CHCSS in the issuance of written approval to conduct the information assurance activities assigned to NSA/CSS, including the conduct of activities that may result in the collection of U.S. person information as defined in DoD Regulation 5240.1-R (Reference e) and other applicable guidance.","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2200,"width":1700}},{"index":112,"markdown":"# (U) RESPONSIBILITIES \n\n4.

They govern the conduct by the United States Signals Intelligence System of signals intelligence activities that involve the collection, retention and dissemination of communications originated or intended for receipt in the United States, and signals intelligence activities that are directed intentionally against the communications of a United States person who is outside the United States. These procedures also govern the collection, retention and dissemination of information concerning United States persons that is collected by the United States Signals Intelligence System including such activities undertaken by the National Association of the United States of the United States. These procedures do not apply to signals intelligence activities that are not required under Executive Order 12333 to be conducted pursuant to procedures approved by the Attorney General. Further, these procedures do not apply to signals intelligence activities directed against the radio communications of air and sea vessels for the purpose of collecting foreign intelligence regarding international narcotics trafficking or in support of federal law enforcement efforts to interdict such trafficking. Such signals intelligence activities are subject to a separate classified annex approved earlier by the Attorney General (See Annex J to United States Signals Intelligence Directive 18). Except for matters expressly authorized herein, the limitations contained in Department of Defense Regulation 5240.1-R also apply to the United States Signals Intelligence System. Reference should be made to those procedures with respect to matters of applicability and scope, definitions, policy and operational procedures not covered herein.\n\nSec. 2: Definitions (U)\n(U) The following additional definitions or supplements to definitions in DoD Regulation 5240.1-R apply solely to this Classified Annex:\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    (1) Agent of a Foreign Power.

It is recognized, however, that the United States Signals Intelligence System may incidentally intercept nonforeign communications, including those of or concerning United States persons, in the course of authorized collection of foreign communications. The United States Signals Intelligence System makes every reasonable effort, through surveys and technical means, to reduce to the maximum extent possible the number of such incidental intercepts acquired in the conduct of its operations. Information derived from these incidentally intercepted non-foreign communications may be disseminated to the Federal Bureau of Investigation when the information is foreign intelligence or counterintelligence or indicates a threat to the physical safety of any person. Dissemination of such information is also governed by these procedures and applicable minimization procedures approved in accordance with FISA. Specific communications sent from or intended for receipt by the United States persons are not intercepted deliberately by the United States Signals Intelligence System unless specific authorization for such interception has been obtained in accordance with these procedures.\n\nThe President has authorized, and the Attorney General hereby specifically approves, interception by the United States Signals Intelligence System of:\n\n* National Diplomatic Communications;\n* International Commercial Communications;\n* Illicit Communications;\n* United States and Allied Military exercise communications;","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2200,"width":1700}},{"index":121,"markdown":"# SECRET//COMINT// \n\n* Signals collected during the search of the signals environment for foreign communications that may be developed into sources of signals intelligence;\n* Signals collected during the monitoring of foreign electronic surveillance activities directed at United States communications consistent with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978; and\n* Signals collected during the testing and training of personnel in the use of signals intelligence collection equipment in the United States consistent with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978.\n\nSec. 4: Procedures (U)\nA. $\\leftrightarrows$ Signals Intelligence: Communications of, or concerning, United States persons.

In those instances in which the diplomatic status of the alien is established, or Attorney General approval for continued surveillance is obtained, communications of, or concerning, the alien may be disseminated in accordance with subsection 4.A. 4 of these procedures.\n(3) If the United States Signals Intelligence System is intentionally collecting communications of, or concerning, a United States citizen or permanent resident alien abroad, it must terminate the surveillance promptly upon learning that person is in the United States. Electronic surveillance may be reinstituted only in accordance with FISA.

Retention (U) \n\n(1) Foreign communications of, or concerning, United States persons that are intercepted by the United States Signals Intelligence System may be retained in their original form or as transcribed only:\n(a) if processed so as to eliminate any reference to United States persons;\n(b) if necessary to the maintenance of technical data bases. Retention for this purpose is permitted for a period sufficient to allow a thorough exploitation and to permit access to data that are, or are reasonably believed likely to become, relevant to a current or future intelligent requirement. Sufficient duration may vary with the nature of the exploitation. In the context of a cryptanalytic effort, sufficient duration may consist of a period of time during which encrypted material is subject to, or of use in, cryptanalysis. In the case of international commercial communications that may contain the identity of United States persons and that are not enciphered or otherwise thought to contain secret meaning, sufficient duration is one year unless the Deputy Director for Operations, National Security Agency, determines in writing that retention for a longer period is required to respond to authorized foreign intelligence or counterintelligence requirements; or\n(c) if dissemination of such communications without elimination of references to such United States persons would be permitted under section 4.A. 4 below.\n\n## 3.

The review of such selection terms shall include an examination of whether such selection terms have in the past resulted in the acquisition of foreign intelligence.\n(c) Selection terms based on content that have resulted or that are reasonably likely to result in the interception of communications to or from a United States person shall be designed to defeat, to the extent practicable under the circumstances, the interception of such communications not containing foreign intelligence.\n(2) Foreign communications collected by the United States Signals Intelligence System or other authorized entities may be forwarded to the National Security Agency as intercepted.

PROCEDURES FOR REPORTING OUESTIONABLE INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES AND SIGNIFICANT OR HIGHLY SENSITIVE MATTERS\n\n## 1. REPORTING PARAMETERS\n\na. The DoD Components shall report the following matters to the ATSD(IO) in accordance with References (a) and (d).\n(1) Questionable Intelligence Activity. An intelligence activity, as defined in E.O. 12333 (Reference (f)), that may be unlawful or contrary to executive order, Presidential directive, or applicable DoD policy governing that activity.\n(2) Significant or Highly Sensitive Matters. A development or circumstance involving an intelligence activity or intelligence personnel that could impugn the reputation or integrity of the DoD Intelligence Community or otherwise call into question the propriety of an intelligence activity. Such matters might be manifested in or by an activity:\n(a) Involving congressional inquiries or investigations.\n(b) That may result in adverse media coverage.\n(c) That may impact on foreign relations or foreign partners.\n(d) Related to the unauthorized disclosure of classified or protected information, such as information identifying a sensitive source and method. Reporting under this paragraph does not include reporting of routine security violations.\n(3) Crimes Reported to the Attorney General. Any intelligence activity that has been or will be reported to the Attorney General, or that must be reported to the Attorney General as required by law or other directive, including crimes reported to the Attorney General as required by Department of Justice-DoD Memorandum of Understanding (Reference (g)).\nb. Unless extenuating circumstances exist, the ATSD(IO) will be notified prior to briefings of any congressional committee or member of Congress concerning intelligence matters identified in paragraphs 1.a.(1), 1.a.(2), and 1.a.(3) of this attachment. Should extenuating circumstances, in fact, delay notification to the ATSD(IO) until after the briefing, then the ATSD(IO) will be notified of the outcome of the briefing at the first opportunity thereafter.","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2200,"width":1700}},{"index":138,"markdown":"c. The DoD Component assigned to or conducting intelligence activities may establish internal organizational reporting responsibilities pursuant to that Component's internal policies and regulations.\n2. SUBMISSION OF REPORTS. DoD Components assigned to conduct intelligence and counterintelligence activities shall submit reports to the ATSD(IO) in accordance with the following guidance.\na. Report questionable intelligence activities of a serious nature and all significant or highly sensitive matters immediately. Such reports may be made by any secure means. Oral reports should be documented with a written report as soon as possible thereafter.\nb. Report questionable intelligence activities not of a serious nature quarterly. Reporting periods shall be based on the calendar year. The first report for each calendar year shall cover January 1 through March 31. Succeeding reports shall follow at 3-month intervals. Quarterly reports are due to the ATSD(IO) by the 15th day of the month following the end of the quarter. Quarterly reports will describe all questionable intelligence activities as well as significant or highly sensitive matters identified during the quarter. Quarterly reports are routinely submitted to the ATSD(IO) through normal modes of routing and transmission (e.g., chain of command, hard or soft copy). Quarterly reports are required even if no reportable matters occurred during the reporting period.\nc. Reporting DoD Components will format all reports as follows:\n(1) Assignment of a Case Number for Each Incident. Except where the volume of incident investigations that have been reported and closed within the same reporting quarter makes the assigning of a case number to each case impracticable, a case number that runs consecutively and identifies the reported incident by reporting agency, Military Department, or Combatant Command and calendar year shall be assigned to each incident. For example: \"DIA 2009 - 04\" would indicate the fourth incident reported by DIA in calendar year 2009. Use this number each time the incident is mentioned in initial reports, and in update and close-out reports. A case number will be assigned to all reported incidents that, at a minimum, are the subject of an ongoing investigation.\n(2) Information to be Included in Each Report. For each incident reported, include the following information as it becomes available.\n(a) A narrative describing each incident reported.","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2200,"width":1700}},{"index":139,"markdown":"(b) An explanation of why the incident is being reported either as a potential violation of law, potentially contrary to executive order or Presidential directive, or a potential violation of Reference (b) and/or agency or Military Department procedures implementing Reference (f). Cite the portions of relevant law, order, policy, or regulation as it is determined.\n(c) An explanation of why the incident is considered a significant or highly sensitive matter, if so reported.\n(d) An analysis of how or why the incident occurred.\n(e) An assessment of the anticipated impact of the reported incident on national security or international relations, as well as any mitigation efforts, including success and failures of such efforts. If there has been no impact or no impact is anticipated, the report should so state.\n(f) Remedial action taken or planned to prevent recurrence of the incident.\n(g) An assessment of any impact the reported incident may have on civil liberties or protected privacy rights.\n(h) A description of actions taken if the incident concerns information improperly acquired, handled, used, or destroyed.\n(i) Any additional information considered relevant for purposes of fully informing the Secretary and/or Deputy Secretary of Defense, the IOB, and the DNI and providing context about the incident.\nd. Each quarterly report should be organized under the major headings of \"New Incidents\" and \"Updates on Previously Reported Incidents.\" The latter heading includes incidents still under inquiry as well as those resolved and closed during the quarter.\ne. Additionally, each quarterly report will contain a summary of gravity, frequency, trends and patterns of the questionable intelligence activities, and/or significant or highly sensitive incidents reported during that quarter, to the extent that they can be determined. Otherwise, the summary should be provided, as the information becomes available, in a subsequent quarterly report.\nf. The quarterly report shall include a description of any inspection findings or intelligence oversight program developments, such as publication of a revised intelligence oversight regulation, that the reporting DoD Component believes is significant.
