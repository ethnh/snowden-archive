Such \"rolodexes\" may contain contact information for foreign political or military leaders, to include direct line, fax, residence and cellular numbers.\n(C) In one recent case, a US official provided NSA with 200 phone numbers to 35 world leaders. S2 Operations Staff immediately supplied this information to the S2 Production Centers (PCs). Despite the fact that the majority is probably available via open source, the PCs have noted 43 previously unknown phone numbers. These numbers plus several others have been tasked to OCTAVE.\n(C) Thus far, the PCs have noted little reportable intelligence from these particular numbers, which appear not to be used for sensitive discussions. However, these numbers have provided lead information to other numbers that have subsequently been tasked.\n(C) This success leads S2 to wonder if there are NSA liaisons whose supported customers may be willing to share their rolodexes or phone lists with NSA as potential sources of intelligence. S2 welcomes such information! Anyone who can help us obtain such phone lists should contact the S203 Operations Staff Access Team at","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":800,"width":1392}}],"model":"mistral-ocr-2503-completion","usage_info":{"pages_processed":1,"doc_size_bytes":151276}}
