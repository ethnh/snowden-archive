(TS//SI//REL) Site Makes First-Ever Collect of High-Interest 4G Cellular Signal
FROM: and RAINFALL (F78)
Run Date: 02/23/2010
(TS//SI//REL) A collaborative effort between on-site collectors, engineers, and off-site contractors in mid-January 2010 allowed RAINFALL to make what is believed to be the first collection, by any known asset, of Time Division-Long Term Evolution (TD-LTE) 4G (fourth generation) cellular communications. Exploitation of this signal, an all-Internet Protocol successor to 2G and 3G cellular systems, is a very high priority for NSA and the Intelligence Community. The TD-LTE signal will enter the market in 2010 and become globally important by 2012.
