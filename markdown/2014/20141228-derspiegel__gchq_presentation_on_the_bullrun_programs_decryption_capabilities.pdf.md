## Response to improving security

- For the past decade, NSA has lead an aggressive, multi-pronged effort to break widely used Internet encryption technologies
- Cryptanalytic capabilities are now coming on line
- Vast amounts of encrypted Internet data which have up till now been discarded are now exploitable
- Major new processing systems, SIGDEV efforts and tasking must be put in place to capitalize on this opportunity

## Sensitivities

- Cryptanalytic capabilities
- Are extremely difficult and costly to acquire
- Require a long lead time
- Depend on sensitive sources
- Are very fragile
- If lost, may never be regained
- The mere "fact of" a capability is very sensitive:
- An adversary who knows what we can/cannot break is able to elude our capabilities even without knowing the technical details of how. the capabilities work

## Protecting BULLRUN Capabilities

- Technical and operational details
- Need to be known only by cryptanalysts and those who enable cryptanalysis
- Protected by established ECI's
- PICARESQUE , PAWLEYS, AMBULANT, ...
- "Fact of" information
- Needs to be known very widely within the SIGINT production chain
- Protect with new secure community of interest (COI)

## Protecting the Info - Secure COI

- Secure Community of Interest (COI) - protects "fact of" as well as volume and scope of the capability
- BULLRUN indoctrination required for access to COI
- BULLRUN-related material, data - decrypted content and decrypted metadata, and details must be protected within the COI

# TOP SECRET STRAP1 

## Protecting the information

- BULLRUN is for internal (Sigint) use only
- Implemented at NSA \&CSEC; DSD \& GCSB to follow
- Not to be shared with UK Partners / customers
- EP not to reveal sources \& methods; further guidance to be developed
- BULLRUN brief on Gcwiki for reference

## Examples

- (S S1) Unspecified capabilities against [VPNs, IPSEC, TLS/SSL, HTTPS, SSH, PPTP, eChat, eVoIP]
- (TS S1 COMINT) Capabilities against the encryption used in [VPNs, IPSEC, TLS/SSL, HTTPS, SSH, PPTP, eChat, eVoIP]

## BULLRUN Bottom Line

- Groundbreaking capabilities
- Extremely fragile
- Do not ask about or speculate on sources or methods underpinning BULLRUN successes
- Indoctrination required for access to secure COI
