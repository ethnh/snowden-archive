# CES/SSC/AAD VPN "Surge" 

- Main Goal:
- To evaluate SCS VPN access and analysis to determine better methods of identifying and exploiting networks of interest.
- Two Focuses:
- What can we do with VPN data that is already ingested into the system?
- Find better methods of reporting VPN stats and exploitation determinations from CES back to SSC and site.
- Are there methods to better identify and survey VPN's to provide CES the data they need?
- Can we leverage MIRROR, DARKQUEST, PANOPLY survey information to quickly identify and report the presence of VPN's in surveyed signals?
- Can we use BIRDWATCHER or other means to automatically resurvey for key exchanges and obtain paired collect?
