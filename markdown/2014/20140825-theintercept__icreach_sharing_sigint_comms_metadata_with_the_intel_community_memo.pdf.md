(C/REL) Remember when you were little and your mom always told you it was nice to share? I don't know about you, but sometimes in the intervening years it seems we forget about that little axiom. Recently those of us who are members of the Intelligence Community (IC) have been advised that we have to do a lot more sharing. Congress has told us, the $9 / 11$ and WMD ${ }^{1}$ Commissions have reminded us, and the Department of Defense strategy for improving operations insists on information sharing. While NSA has been sharing information for years through tailored product reporting, write-to-release efforts, ELINT ${ }^{2}$ metadata and tearline reporting, we are now going a step beyond that and are actually sharing SIGINT comm unications metadata through a program called ICREACH.
(S//REL) ICREACH intends to make more metadata accessible to our Intelligence Community brethren primarily for the purposes of situational awareness and target development. This COMINT ${ }^{3}$ metadata is not to be used for targeting; instead provisioning of the metadata to IC intelligence analysts should foster greater collaboration on targets of interest. Like NSA's internal tool, GLOBALREACH, ICREACH is a one-stop shopping tool for consolidated communications metadata analytic needs.
(S//REL) Through ICREACH, IC analysts can access all appropriate data sets related to telephony (and eventually $\mathrm{DNI}^{4}$ data) with a single login. The IC intelligence analysts will be validated by the ICREACH point of contact from their particular agency, must be part of the U.S. Intelligence Community, must hold a TS//SI clearance and must have a PKI certificate in order to access the data through JWICS ${ }^{5}$. Each person will be provided an account only after their need for it is verified by the Agency POC and they have received training on the tool, the procedures, and the technologies represented in the metadata.
(S//SI/REL) For the first time, IC intelligence analysts will have immediate access to SIGINT 1st Party metadata as soon as the data is loaded in the centralized metadata repository. The FASCIA, Call, PCS ${ }^{6}$, and INMARSAT tables will be the first ones accessed in the ICREACH Beta release, now being piloted by a very limited number of IC analysts ${ }^{7}$. Reference data from other NSA projects like ASSOCIATION, TAPERLAY, and CONTRAOCTAVE is also queried. If the number is tasked in OCTAVE, a simple "yes" is returned with the event data.
(S//SI/REL) Responses thus far from the beta testers have been largely positive with some very interesting questions, comments, observations and suggestions being provided, considered, and where possible, implemented. Future plans call for a rollout to additional IC agencies and Unified Commands (DIA and STRATCOM ${ }^{8}$ are nest on the list for training) and access to other sources of metadata. NSA and CIA are developing an interface to enable access to their metadata through
ICREACH/GLOBALREACH so that there is a reciprocal exchange of information.
(U//FOUO) If you have questions on ICREACH, you may direct them to the following individuals:

- For questions about the rollout of ICREACH to the next sets of users: S1, S1,
- For questions about the data available within ICREACH: $\square$
- For questions about the technical workings of ICREACH: $\square$ all
