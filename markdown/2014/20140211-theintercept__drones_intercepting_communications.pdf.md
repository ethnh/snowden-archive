(S//SI//REL) Testing the New Technique on a UAV
(TS//SI//REL) As part of the GILGAMESH (PREDATOR-based active geolocation) effort, this team used some advanced mathematics to develop a new geolocation algorithm intended for operational use on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flights.
(TS//SI//NF) The VICTORYDANCE mission was a great experience. It was truly a joint interagency effort between CIA and NSA. Flights and targets were coordinated with both CIAers and NSAers. The mission lasted 6 months, during which 43 flights were flown.
Our mission (VICTORYDANCE) mapped the Wi-Fi fingerprint of nearly every major town in Yemen
(U) The Death of Anwar Nasser Aulaqi
(TS//NF) Anwar Nasser Aulaqi, a dual U.S./Yemeni citizen, regional commander for AQAP, and well-known extremist lecturer who preached at two U.S. mosques attended by some of the September 2001 hijackers, was killed in Yemen on 30 September 2011. The CIA tracked Aulaqi for three weeks before a joint operation with the U.S. military killed Aulaqi. The special operation killed four operatives, including Samir Khan, another American who played a key role in inspiring attacks against the U.S. Aulaqi's death represents another integrated CIA and military success in the counterterrorism fight.

DISTANTFOCUS pod is new system for tactical SIGINT and precision geolocation... first deployed in December (S)
(U//FOUO) What resembles "LITTLE BOY" (one of the atomic bombs dropped on Japan during World War II) and as LITTLE BOY did, represents the dawn of a new era (at least in SIGINT and precision geolocation)?
(S) If you answered a pod mounted on an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) that is currently flying missions in support of the Global War on Terrorism, you would be correct.
