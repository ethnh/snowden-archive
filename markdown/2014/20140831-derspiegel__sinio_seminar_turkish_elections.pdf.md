(U//FOUO) The SINIO Council and the National Cryptologic School are pleased to present the 16th in a series of Strategic Intelligence Issue Seminars for 2007. "Turkish Presidential and Parliamentary Elections: Dynamics, Regional Impact, and Relations with the United States" will be presented by SINIO for Russia/Europe/Eurasia.

# Course Overview: 

(U) The likely presidential candidacy of Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan is a redline for the Turkish military because they distrust his commitment to secularism. Concerns about Kurdish terrorism, the potential for an independent Iraqi Kurdish Regional Government, Turkey's EU candidacy, and the pending U.S. congressional resolution on the Armenian genocide issue will also be issues of concern--with anti-American overtones.
(U//FOUO) To register, and for further info on this series of seminars, please consult the SINIO Events Website. Any questions or concerns regarding registration should be directed to the National Cryptologic School.
