CNE Access to BELGACOM GRX Operator: (GREEN) Following the successful NAC MyNOC OP SOCIALIST to provide CNE access to the BELGACOM GRX Operator (MERION ZETA), the NAC have continued to provide assistance in mapping out the internal network and providing direction to the CNE operator on the best internal devices on which to have a presence. The end goal has been to enable access to internal GRX routers that can then be used as platforms for MitM operations against mobile handsets that are roaming.
