## (U//FOUO) STELLARWIND Classification Guide

(U) National Security Agency/Central Security Service (NSA/CSS): Classification Guide Number: 2-400
(U//FOUO) Project/Activity Name: STELLARWIND (STLW)
(U) Office of Origin: NSA/CSS Signals Intelligence Directorate (SID)
(U//FOUO) POC: William J. Amass, CT Special Projects
(U) Phone: 963-0087/963-0491(s)
(U//FOUO) Classified By: Keith B. Alexander, Lieutenant General, United States Army, Director, National Security Agency.
(U) Declassify On: 25 Years*
(U//FOUO) Note: This guide provides classification guidance for information requiring marking and handling under the STELLARWIND special compartment.
(TS//SI//NF) In January 2008, the Director of National Intelligence authorized certain information associated with STELLARWIND, as well as related information authorized under Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) orders (such as the Large Content Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) orders, Business Records (BR) FISA orders and the Pen Register Trap and Trace (PR/TT) FISA orders), to be removed from the STELLARWIND compartment. This guide addresses information associated with STELLARWIND and associated classification instructions, while classification guidance associated with FISA information can be found, in one location, in an NSA/CSS FISA/Protect America Act (PAA)/FISA Amendments Act (FAA) classification guide authored by NSA SID Oversight and Compliance (SV). Consequently, this document will reference an NSA/CSS FISA/PAA/FAA classification guidance where information formerly associated with STELLARWIND is now authorized by the FISC. Also, this document references classification guidelines for FISA/PAA/FAA information and within Exceptionally Controlled Information (ECI) compartments within NSA where necessary. Users should reference both guides to determine proper classification. Additional Annexes are provided as additional information to assist the users of this guide.
(TS//SI//NF) The markings "TSP" and "Compartmented" were at times used in briefing materials and documentation associated with the STELLARWIND program. "TSP" and "Compartmented" were used primarily by the National Security Agency (NSA) Legislative Affairs Office (LAO), NSA Office of General Counsel (OGC), and the Executive Branch in briefings and declarations intended for external audiences, such as Congress and the courts. The term "TSP" was initially used in relation to only that portion of the Program that was publicly disclosed by the

# TOP SECRET//SI//ORCON/NOFORN 

President in December 2005. These markings should be considered the same as the STELLARWIND marking, but should not be directly associated with the program. The identifier "STARBURST" was also used in the earliest days of the program and should also be considered the same as "STELLARWIND."

## (U) ANNEX A:

## (TS//SI//NF) FISA PR/TT and BR

(TS//SI//NF) Information acquired under court authorization via FISA PR/TT or FISA BR, but currently marked STLW (e.g. FISA PR/TT or FISA BR information commingled in databases with other STLW information, or otherwise controlled as STLW due to overlapping authorizations), is eligible to be removed from the STLW compartment. However, information may not be removed from the STLW compartment without appropriate action by an original classification authority under Executive Order 12958, as amended, or coordination with the STLW Program Manager (PM) or D/PM, S12 Information Sharing
# TOP SECRET//SI//ORCON/NOFORN 

Services, and OGC. The NSA OGC can be used as an initial POC/contact point. Although compartmented controls may be removed from the FISA PR/TT and FISA BR information currently marked STLW, court ordered access controls and classification guidelines must continue to be observed. Users should note that classification guidance for FISA/PAA/FAA/FAA information can be found in an NSA/CSS FISA/PAA/FAA guide.
(TS//SI//NF) For example, the FISA/PAA/FAA classification guide should be consulted when deriving classification for FISA PR/TT or FISA BR information currently marked STLW such as:

## (TS//SI//NF) FISA PR/TT (initiated 17 July 2004)

1. (TS//SI//NF) FISA PR/TT information collected, stored, processed under FISA authorization.
2. (TS//SI//NF) FISA PR/TT targeting information - email address forms, query requests and approvals, selectors queried, query results, alert lists.
3. (TS//SI//NF) FISA PR/TT-related Mainway databases, realms \& data flows and all related technical data, collection statistics, and software.
4. (TS//SI//NF) FISA PR/TT-related working aids, briefing materials, query logs, etc.

## (TS//SI//NF) BR FISA (initiated 24 May 2006)

1. (TS//SI//NF) FISA BR information collected, stored, processed under FISA authorization.
2. (TS//SI//NF) FISA BR targeting information - address forms, query requests and approvals, selectors queried, query results, alert lists, etc.
3. (TS//SI//NF) FISA BR-related Mainway Databases, realms \& data flows and all related technical data, collection statistics, and software.
4. (TS//SI//NF) FISA BR-related Working Aids, briefing materials, query logs, etc.

## (U) Preservation Requirements and Other Related Issues

(U//FOUO) Documentation you have originated (memos, analytic summaries, etc.) - do not destroy/remove/delete. Please contact the SID PMO for questions. Your records may constitute valuable temporary or permanent records and may be transferred to a designated official or records officer, records include documents created regarding STLW policies, decisions, procedures and essential operational, logistical and support transactions.
(U//FOUO) SIGINT Reporting -You are authorized to retain published reporting marked with the STLW caveat, however further dissemination of the information contained in those reports must be coordinated through the SIGINT Intelligence Directorate Counterterrorism RFI process and accurately sourced to the original STLW report number/title.
# TOP SECRET//SI//ORCON/NOFORN 

(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Other STLW information - Record Retention Order - In addition to your obligations under Federal Records Act and NSA Policy, you are reminded that Judge Vaughn Walker, USDJ, issued a Preservation order on November 6, 2007 relating to litigation challenging the surveillance activities authorized by the President after the attacks of September 11, 2001. You should preserve and retain any (hardcopy or electronic - including email) information, documents or data that may be relevant to that litigation. If you have any questions about this obligation, you should contact your Office of General Counsel.
(S//NF) NSA-generated materials submitted to a court in support of ongoing litigation which contains facts that reveal scope and scale of the Presidentially Authorized Program should be handled as STLW. Note: Many litigation documents were marked as TSP instead of STLW. These documents, and supporting facts, relate directly to the special authorization and remain STLW-compartmented.
