(U//FOUO) NCRs with Foreign Relations Missions Become 'SUSLAs'

FROM:
Foreign Affairs Directorate Staff (DP09)
Run Date: 08/30/2006
(U//FOUO) Over the years the term "NSA/CSS Representative" (NCR) has grown to include Agency representatives at a variety of places: Commands, other US Government agencies, US embassies in support of Third Party agreements, etc.
(S//SI) Recently, we created another title specifically for our representatives to major Third Parties: "Special US Liaison Advisor" (SUSLAs), who are the senior representatives of the DIRNSA/CHCSS to a specific Third Party. The first SUSLA named was Special US Liaison Advisor, Italy, and Special US Liaison Advisor, Germany, followed shortly thereafter.
(U//FOUO) Until recently, a few of the NCRs have been performing SUSLA duties but were still called NCRs. This led to some measure of confusion in a variety of administrative matters, mostly within headquarters. By changing the titles of these NCRs to SUSLAs we have eliminated this confusion and provided a more rational approach to titles by re-designating those positions that are primarily foreign affairs-related as SUSLAs,> reserving the title NCR to those senior representatives with primarily Command and other US Government Agency representation.
(U//FOUO) Note that this change applies to the title only - not to mission, function, authorities, duties, or reporting chain. There is also no change in relationships and existing oversight authorities arranged between these positions, NSA/CSS Europe or NSA/CSS Pacific, and the Foreign Affairs Directorate.
(S//SI) The following NCRs' titles have changed:

- NCR Turkey is now Special US Liaison Advisor, Turkey (SUSLAT)
- NCR Thai is now Special US Liaison Advisor, Thailand (SUSLAB)
- NCRJ is now Special US Liaison Advisor, Japan (SUSLAJ)
- NCR KOR is already dual-titled as Special US Liaison Advisor, Korea; the use of the NCR KOR title is being phased out (SUSLAK)

FYI, The Special US Liaison Advisor refers to the chief of the site, while Special US Liaison Activity refers to the site itself. Either way, it's "SUSLA"!
(U//FOUO) Note that our Special US Liaison Officers located in Second Party nations are SUSLOs, and are all designated with the name of the partner's capital city (e.g., SUSLOL = Special US Liaison Officer, London). Those titles have not been changed.
