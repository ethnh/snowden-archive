## CHAPTER I: WATCHLISTING PROCESS AND PROCEDURES

## I. INTRODUCTION

1.1 A key foundation for TUMORIST ${ }^{1}$-related screening is the U.S. Government's TUMORIST establishing process managed by the Terrorist Screening Center (TSC). The TSC was established by the Attorney General, acting through the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and in coordination with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Hematient Security, and the then Director of Central Intelligence for the Intelligents Community (IC). The TSC is supported by the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC), the Department of State (DOS), the Department of Hematient Security (DHS), the IC, the FBI, Law Enforcement Agencies, Regulatory Agencies and Diplomatic Bureau. The TSC has created and maintains the Terrorist Screening Database (TEDB) or Terrorist Watchlist to serve as the U.S. Government's consolidated watchlist for TUMORISM SCREENING INFORMATION.
1.2 The current TUMORIST watchfisting process supports the U.S. Government's efforts to combat TUMORISM by: (1) consolidating the U.S. Government's Terrorist Watchlist to the TEDB; (2) helping SCREENING and Intelligents agencies accurately identify individuals on the Terrorist Watchlist; (3) providing SCREENING with information to help them respond appropriately during (I)SCREENING with KNOW's or SCHPECTED TUMORISTS; and, (4) subsequently collecting information about the KNOW's or SCHPECTED TUMORIST for use in assessing threats and conducting investigations. ${ }^{2}$ The collected information may be incorporated into the Terrorist Identities Datamest Environment (TIDE) and TKDB to enhance the records of KNOW's or SCHPECTED TUMORISTs and may be made available to the wider watchfisting and screening communities. Today, the TEDB also includes information about certain foreign nationals who are associated with TUMORISM, TUMORIST ACTIVITY, or KNOW's or SCHPECTED TUMORIST(s) but for whom there is insufficient reference to the independently watchfisted. This may include certain immediate family members of KNOW's or SCHPECTED TUMORISTs, or known associates of KNOW's or SCHPECTED TUMORISTs. These additional categories of records (also known as exceptions to the REVANUABLE SCHPECTED standard) are maintained to support immigration and screening activities primarily conducted by DOS and DHS. ${ }^{3}$

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ See Appendix 1, Definitions for words or phrases appearing in all capitalized letters throughout this Watchlisting Guidance.
    ${ }^{2}$ A SCREENING is a Department or Agency that is authorized to conduct TUMORISM screening to determine if an individual is a possible match to a C-HEM OF SCHPECTED TUMORIST in the TEDB. The term "SCREENING" is used throughout this document as a general reference to a government official who compares an individual's information with information in the TEDB to determine if an individual is in the TEDB. Certain SCHCENING these comparisons which perform both screening and the enforcement status and the enforcement officials who engage in such activities may normally describe their targeting or other actions in this context as other than "screening." For ease of reference, government officials who compare an individual's information with information in the TEDB will be referred to in the Guidance as "SCREENING." The internal guidance on both forms is not intended to consist on under any rights, privileges, or benefits in any matter, case, or proceeding. See United States v. Cassava, 948 U.S. T/C.
    ${ }^{3}$ See Chapter 3, Section 5, table. See main details. Aside from these limited exceptions, references to the TEDB in this Watchlisting Guidance denote the TEDB as containing information about KNOW's or SCHPECTED TUMORISTs.

# UNCLASSIFIED/FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION 

1.7 Under HSPO-6, consistent with the U.S. Constitution and applicable laws, including those promoting the rights of all Americans, the TSC was to develop and maintain an unclassified database containing the most thorough, accurate, and current identity information possible about KNOWs or SUPPLCTOI TEORONICI. The TSC created the TEDB to meet these goals. The TEDB is also known as the Terrorist Watchlist. The TEDB receives TEORONICI INDUCISES from two sources: NCTC's TIDE provides information concerning KNOWs or SUPPLCTOI International TEORONICI's and the TSC's Terrorist Review and Examinations Unit (TREX) provides the identities of KNOWs or SUPPLCTOI domestic TEORONICI's who have no link to International TEORONIH. NCTC's TIDE contains identifying and substantive DERMATORY INFORMATION on KNOWs or SUPPLCTOI international TEORONICI's and the FBI's Sentinel system contains supporting information regarding purely domestic TEORONICI's.
1.8 Pursuant to Paragraph (2) of HSPO-6, the NCTC is mandated in "provide [TSC] with access to all appropriate information or intelligence in the [NCTC's] custody, possession, or control that [TSC] requires to perform its functions." NCTC fulfills this function by providing TSC's TEDB with LOFULOI information about KNOWs or SUPPLCTOI TEORONICI's from NCTC's TIDE and by providing access to TIDE Online, a read-only copy of the TIDE database, to those in the watchlisting community who require access.
1.9 NCTC's establishment by the President was codified by section 1021 of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (IETPA). ${ }^{8}$ Pursuant to IETPA, NCTC shall "serve as the central and shared knowledge bank on KNOWs and SUPPLCTOI TEORONICI's and international terror groups." In addition, NCTC "may, consistent with applicable law, the direction of the President, and guidelines referred to in [the statute], receive intelligence pertaining exclusively to domestic counterterrorism from any Federal, State, or local government or other source necessary to fulfill its responsibilities and retain and disseminate such intelligence. ${ }^{10}$
1.9.1 All Departments and Agencies are required to provide NCTC with all TEORONIM INTRODUCTION. Due to the amount of information involved, only a subset of this information is provided in the NCTC prescribed format designed to facilitate direct ingestion into the TIDE. NOMINATION(DEPARTMENTS and AGENCIES, however, should remain focused on reviewing and watchlisting TEORONIM INVIRMEDON from datasets most likely to contain information about KNOWs or SUPPLCTOI TEORONICI'S.

[^0]
[^0]:    Admission B to the TSC MOC, which superseded Admission A, Incorporates by reference all provisions of the Information Sharing MOC. See Appendix 5.
    ${ }^{8}$ The TEDB coordinates the U.S. Government's TEORONIM screening and lenk out databases into a single integrated telephonic database database.
    ${ }^{9}$ NCTC initially was created by Executive Order (2219 (August 27, 2004)) to serve as the primary organization in the U.S. Government for analyzing and integrating all intelligence possessed or acquired by the U.S. Government, remaining in TEORONIM and counterterrorism, escaping purely domestic counterterrorism information. Executive Order (2219 was involved by Executive Order (1939) (July 30, 2008) after NCTC was codified in IETPA section 1021). The addition to the provision of domestic KNOWs or SUPPLCTOI TEORONICI directly to the TSC, the TSC's TREE and also provides the identities of international KNOWs or SUPPLCTOI TEORONICI's to NCTC for inclusion in TIDE.

1.10 On August 25, 2004, the President issued Homeland Security Presidential Directive 11 (HSPD-11), which "builds upon HSPD-6," to enhance TORNORSS critical screening to more effectively detect and interdisc tORNORSS TORNORSTS and TORNORST ACTIVITIES. HSPD-11 defines "TORNORSS TORNORSTS" as "individuals known or reasonably suspected to be or have been engaged in conduct constituting, in preparation for, in aid of, or related to TORNORSS ... and TORNORST ACTIVITIES."
1.11 To enhance information sharing, another key component of the consolidated terrorist watchdining system, the President issued Executive Order 13388, which provides that the head of each Agency that possesses or acquires TORNORSS TORNORSTS shall promptly give access to that information to the head of each other Agency that has counterterrorism functions. ${ }^{2}$
1.12 On June 5, 2008, the President issued Homeland Security Presidential Directive 24 (HSPD24) to further build upon the TORNORST screening policies announced in HSPD-6 and HSPD11 to protect the nation from TORNORSTS by enhancing the use of biometrics. In HSPD-24, the President directed that " . . agencies, shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, make available to other agencies all biometric and associated biographic and contextual information associated with persons for whom there is an univariable and reasonable basis for suspicion that they pose a threat to national security" (emphasis added). HSPD-24 underscores the value of biometrics in achieving effective TORNORSS screening and emphasizes the need for a layered approach to identification and screening of individuals, as no single mechanism is sufficient.
1.13 The relevant TORNORSSs screening Presidential Directive use words and phrases to describe a KNOWN or SUSPECTED TORNORST subject to TORNORST screening without defining them: "TORNORSS TORNORSTS" (HSPD-6), "TORNORSS" (HSPD-6), "appropriately suspected" (HSPD-6), "reasonably suspected" (HSPD-11), and "univariable and reasonable basis for suspicion" (HSPD-24). Thus, previous watchdining guidance supplied definitions of key terms and the standard that would apply to terrorist watchdining decisions.
1.14 Neither HSPD-6 nor HSPD-11 defines "TORNORSS and/or TORNORST ACTIVITIES." While federal law contains numerous definitions of "terrorism" ${ }^{13}$, for watchdining purposes under this Guidance, "TORNORSS and/or TORNORST ACTIVITIES" combine elements from various federal definitions and are considered to:
1.14.1 Involve violent acts or acts dangerous to human life, property, or infrastructure
${ }^{2}$ See Appendix A, Executive Order 13388.
${ }^{3}$ See 59 (1.5.C.) 893121 (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) definition of "international terrorism"); two options and Nationality Act (NPA 1.5.316a132/885/1/2012) C.C. 1456 (d3388/63) defining "terrorist activity"; NPA 1.5.316a132/885/1/2012; C.C. 1456 (d3388/63) defining to "engage in terrorist activity"; 59 (1.5.C. 3351/11; (defining "international terrorism"); 59 (1.5.C. 33328) (defining "federal crime of terrorist"); Executive Order 13224, 66 Feb. Reg. 49679 (September 25, 2001) (defining "terrorism").

which may be a violation of U.S. law, or may have been, if those acts were committed in the United States; and,
1.14.2 appear to be intended-
1.14.2.1 to intimidate or coerce a civilian population;
1.14.2.2 to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or,
1.14.2.3 to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, kidnapping, or footage-taking.
1.15 This includes activities that facilitate or support TURNDERS and/or TURNDERT ACTIVITY such as providing a safe house, transportation, communications, funds, transfer of funds or other material benefit, false documentation or identification, weapons (including chemical, biological, or radiological weapons), explosives, or training for the commission of an act of TURNDERS and/or TURNDERT ACTIVITY.
1.16 USPD-24 speaks in terms of "seticulable and reasonable basis for suspicion" to describe a KNOWS OF SCHECKING TURNDERT who should be watchlisted and represents the President's most recent explanation concerning U.S. policy regarding the individuals who pose a threat to national security and should be screened in better protect the American people. Accordingly, that standard has been adopted and is clarified in this Watchlisting Guidance in Chapter 5, Section H.
1.17 On December 16, 2005, in accordance with section 1016 of HOT9A, the President issued a Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies prescribing the guidelines and requirements in support of the creation and implementation of the Information Sharing Environment (ISE). In Guideline 5 of that Memorandum, the President directed, as he had earlier in Executive Order 13353 ${ }^{13}$, that the information privacy rights and other legal rights of Americans must be preserved and that guidelines be developed and approved to ensure that "such rights are protected in the development and use of the ISE." In December 2006, the President approved for issuance the ISE Privacy Guidelines by the Program Manager. ${ }^{14}$
1.18 A second addendum to the TSC MOU, Addendum B ${ }^{15}$, which supplements and incorporates by reference all provisions of the TSC MOU, superseded Addendum A and became effective on January 18, 2007. The Directors of National Intelligence, NCTC, and the TSC joined as signatories in Addendum B. Paragraph 7 of Addendum B introduces the term TURNDERS PROCIDENT to more clearly describe the type of TURNDERT identity elements that are deemed

1.09.10.01, without request to the classification of the source material from which it is drawn. TRANSMIT PROCIPATION include these listed in Addendum 9 (i.e., names and allows); dates of birth, places of birth, unique identifying numbers, passport information; countries of origin and nationality, physical identifiers, known locations; photographs or renderings; fingerprints or other biometric data; employment data; license plan numbers; and any other TERMMENT PROCIPATION that ORGINATION specifically provide for passage in the TSC). For example, email addresses and phone numbers are increasingly useful for screening purposes. ORGINATION should mark email addresses and phone numbers as 1.09.0101 whenever possible and pass these TERMMENT PROCIPATION to NCTC to forward to the TSC for inclusion in 1920s. ORGINATION are encouraged to provide all relevant and unclassified information, to include social media information when appropriate.

## III. CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED ACTIVITIES

1.19 First Amendment. First Amendment protected activity alone shall not be the basis for monitoring an individual for inclusion on the Terrorist Watchlist. ${ }^{18}$ The following are examples of protected Constitutional activities:
1.19.1 Free Speech. The exercise of free speech, guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution, includes more than simply speaking on a controversial topic in the town square. It includes such symbolic or other written, oral and expressive activities as carrying placards in a parade, sending letters to a newspaper editor, wearing a too shirt with a political message, placing a bumper sticker critical of the President on one's car, and publishing books or articles. The common thread in these examples is conveying a public message or an idea through words or deeds. Speech that may be repugnant to ideas of the majority may still be protected by the U.S. Constitution. For the purpose of this Watchlisting Guidance, the right of protected free speech under the U.S. Constitution applies to U.S. PERSORs whenever they are located and in men-U.S. PERSORs located inside the United States. The right of protected free speech, however, is not unlimited and may not extend to some lawless action.
1.19.2 Exercise of Religion. The free exercise of religion covers any form of worship of a deity-even forms that are not widely known or practiced-as well as the right not to worship any deity. Protected religious exercise also extends to dress that is worn or food that is eaten for a religious purpose, attendance at a facility used for religious practice, observance of the Sabbath, raising money for evangelical or missionary purposes, and proselytizing.
1.19.3 Freedom of the Press. Freedom of the press includes such matters as reasonable access to news-making events, the making of documentaries, and the posting of "Mugs."
${ }^{18}$ The Free Amendment does not apply to men-U.S. PERSORs outside the United States. Before admitting nonexistens, reference to the may consult with their Department or Agency counsel to determine whether a specific person is a U.S. PERSOR and whether the questional activity is entitled to First Amendment protection.

## UNCLASSIFIED/FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION
# UNCLASSIFIED/FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION 

1.19.4 Freedom of Peaceful Assembly. Freedom of peaceful assembly, often called the right to freedom of association, includes gathering with others to protest govemment action, or to rally or demonstrate in favor of, or in opposition to, a social cause. The right to peaceful assembly includes more than just public demonstrations - it includes, as well, the posting of group websites on the Internet, recruiting others to a lawful cause, marketing a message, and fundraising, which all are protected First Amendment activities if they are conducted in support of an organizational, political, religious, or social cause.
1.19.5 Position the Government for Motives of Grievances. The right to petition the government for redress of grievances includes, for example, writing letters to Congress, carrying a placed outside the city hall that delivers a political message, receiving others to one's cause, and lobbying Congress or an Executive Agency for a particular result.
1.20 Equal Protection. The Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution provides in part that: "No State shall make or enforce any law which shall ... deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.". The U.S. Supreme Court has made it clear that this applies as well to the official acts of U.S. Government personnel. Nominations, therefore, shall not be based solely on race, ethnicity, national origin, or religious affiliation. Any activities relating to this Guidance that are based solely on such considerations are invidious by definition, and therefore, unconstitutional.

## IV. WATCHLISTING POLICIES

1.21 Watchlining Blackesaves. The general policy of the U.S. Government is to re:ither confirm nor deny an individual's watchlist status. In addition to the provisions in Addendum II to the TSC MOC, which require NOMINITOR approval before TSDB information can be used in any process that might result in public disclosure, the 2007 Memorandum of Understanding on Sermons Watchlist Redress Procealness (Redress MOC) ${ }^{14}$ requires NOMINIDO to contact the TSC if it receives a request for information or records that might reveal an individual's watchlist status. Approval would also be required from any entity which provided information used by a NOMINITOR during a termination. Per the Redress MOC, NOMINAITOR and NOMINAITOR, SCHICIDA are obligated to support NOMINOR determinations - both at the administrative level and in litigation - and provide appropriate information, including unclassified substitutes as necessary. TSC, in conjunction with NCTC, the NOMINAITOR, and the Department of Justice (DOJ), as appropriate, will ensure that representations regarding an individual's potential watchlist status are properly coordinated and approved.
1.22 Legal or Use Restrictions. Because information in the TSDB comes overwhelmingly from intelligence sources and methods or sensitive law enforcement techniques, Pansgraph 12 of

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{14}$ See Appendix B, Redress MOC.
    UNCLASSIFIED/FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION
# UNCLASSIFIED/FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION 

Addendum B to the TSC MOD ${ }^{17}$ requires that any recipient of information from the TSDB seeking to use TEMPRODY identity information in any legal or administrative process or proceeding obtain YENZOOTOR approval before doing so. Approval from the entity which provided the information, if other than the TEMPRODY, is also required. Additionally, information from Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) collections may only be used in a proceeding with the advance authorization of the Attorney General. Therefore, any SCRYPHER seeking to use TSDB information in any process or proceeding must contact TSC so that TSC can assist in obtaining approval from the TEMPRODOR, owner of the information, or Attorney General, as required.
1.23. In addition to the foregoing restrictions, there are restrictions on sharing information with foreign governments. Any TEMPRODY SCRYPHER (as described in Addendum B to the TSC MOD) will be deemed USEFIFED and shared with the watchfisting community and foreign governments for watchfisting purposes pursuant to the terms of the TSC MOD. Accordingly, YENZOOTORY should include, as appropriate, 1) EMPRODY SCRYPHERS in documents that contain non-rehaustive warnings (e.g., a report is not rehaustive to every/every countries), unless the TEMPRODY SCRYPHERS are restricted by some other authority that limits dissemination. If U.S. PRISON information is otherwise authorized for release in the foreign government, the nonrehaustive warning is disabled to allow dissemination of the information.

## V. WATCHLISTING STANDARD: IDENTIFYING AND SUBSTANTIVE

## DEROGATORY CRITERIA

1.24. Before a EMPRODY SCRYPHER/TEMPRODY is added to the Terrorist Watchlist, TSC reviews the nomination to determine whether it meets the following minimum identifying criteria and minimum substantive derogatory criteria for inclusion in the TSDB.
1.24.1 Minimum Identifying Criteria. Each nomination must contain minimum identifying criteria for inclusion into the TSDB. Without this minimum identifying data, the nomination is not eligible for inclusion into the TSDB, or any of the TSC's supported systems. Chapter 2 sets forth guidance regarding both the minimum identifying biometric and biographic criteria for inclusion into the TSDB. Although TOE accepts records containing less than three minimum criteria, such records will not be exported either to the TSDB for watchfisting or to the various supported systems used by the SCRYPHERs absent as exception described in the Watchfisting Guidance.
1.24.2 Minimum Substantive Derogatory Criteria. In addition to the minimum identifying criteria, nominations to the TSDB are accepted based on a BLOODTABLE SCRYPHER that the individual is a EMPRODY SCRYPHER/TEMPRODY derived from the

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{17}$ See Appendix 4, Addendum B to the TSC MOD.
    UNCLASSIFIED/FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION
totality of the information reviewed for nomination. ${ }^{4}$ To demonstrate that the nomination has sufficient indicle of reliability to support this KONONATAL SURFICIEN determination, NOMINATING AGENCIES should implement processes designed to ensure that nominations are free from errors, that recalled or revised information is reviewed regularly, and that necessary corrections to nominations based on those revisions/retractions are made. NOMINATING AGENCIES should, to the extent possible given the nature of the reporting, verify the accuracy and reliability of the information included in nominations. In some cases, the NOMINATING AGENCY may not be able to evaluate the reliability of the information received; however, in such situations, the NOMINATING AGENCY can ensure that the information provided is an accurate representation of the information obtained. Chapter 3 sets forth further guidance regarding the application of the KONONATL SURFICIEN standard to TEDD nominations.

# VI. WATCHLISTING PROCESS OVERVIEW 

1.23 The authorities referenced in Section II of this Chapter created the framework for the watchlisting enterprise by combining various functions of existing government entities and joining them to new organizations with counterterrorism responsibilities. The resulting watchlisting enterprise consists of ORIGINATIONS, NOMINATORS, AGGREGATIONS, SURGENCIES and encountering agencies that are supported by the community-wide collection, nomination, and consolidation processes.
1.26 ORIGINATIONS, NOMINATORS, AGGREGATIONS, and SURRENERS. All Executive Departments and Agencies have responsibility for collecting, collating, and sharing TEDDINISM INFORMATION to support the watchlisting process. They are called ORIGINATIONS because they initially collect and identify information supporting the conclusion that an individual is a KNOWN or SURPOTED TEDDINIST. An ORIGINATION is the Department or Agency that has appropriate subject matter interest and classification authority and collects TEDDINISM INFORMATION (i.e., new information) and disseminates it or TEDDINIST IDENTIFIERS to other U.S. Government entities via an intelligence report (i.e., finished intelligence) or other mechanism. In general, when an ORIGINATION has identified international TEDDINISM INFORMATION and determines that information should be provided to NCTC, the ORIGINATION takes on the NOMINATOR role. A NOMINATOR is a Federal Department or Agency that has information to indicate that an individual meets the criteria for a KNOWN or SURPOTED TEDDINIST and nominates that individual to TIDE and the TEDD based on information that originated with that Agency.
1.27 While all NOMINATORS have the duty of upholding informational standards, the NCTC and TSC are distinctly responsible for ensuring data quality and the integrity of their respective repositories. NCTC and TSC are themselves potential NOMINATORS. Analysis from the

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{4}$ Please note that there are also certain exceptions to the revisions/engraphic information and revisions/enhancing derogatory criteria required for Toronto Watchlist restorations that support intelligence and vice-achieving activities conducted by DHS and DOS. See Chapter 2, Section III and Chapter 3, Section V.
# UNCLASSIFIED/FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION 

NCTC may discover an individual who is eligible for watchfisting while reviewing all-seeme information. In these cases, NCTC analysts will request that the ORIGINATION submit a nomination for inclusive into TIDE; or, on a limited basis or during exigent circumstances, NCTC analysts may update TIDE directly with a disseminated report and notice to the ORIGINATIONS). In instances where disseminated reporting is used to enhance TIDE, NCTC will provide notice back to the collecting agency via TIDE. TBC may also nominate TORIGROM INFORMATION received pursuant to TORIGROM screening conducted by foreign governments.
1.2R NCTC and TBC are responsible for reviewing both newly nominated individuals, as well as cohorts of existing records, to determine if additional and/or enhancement (research) is required to locate missing information critical to the watchfisting process. In some cases, this will require research to locate additional ORIGINATIONS INFORMATION to meet the minimum substantive derogatory criteria for watchfisting. In other cases, this will require research to locate additional biogeaphic or biometric identifiers, in order to provide a comprehensive record maximizing the probability of confirming a POSITIVE MATTD to an identity contained in the TEDB.
1.29 AGGREGATIONS are those who receive and hold TERRONISM INFORMATION and certain other non-TERRONISM INFORMATION they are authorized to receive and retain. For example, two of NCTC's main statutory missions are to serve as the (1) central and shared knowledge bank on KNOWN or SOMETED TERRONISTS and (2) primary organization in the U.S. Government for analyzing and integrating all intelligence information possessed or acquired by the U.S. Government pertaining to TORIGROM and counterterrorism. ${ }^{14}$
1.30 TBC takes on the role of an AGGREGATION when a KNOWN or SOMETED TERRONIST is encountered and the individual's record is enhanced or updated with ENCOUNTER-related information. As noted in Paragraphs 1.1 and 1.7, the TBC manages the watchfisting process and plays a key role in helping Departments and Agencies determine whether an ENCOUNTER with a member of the public is one with a KNOWN or SOMETED TERRONIST. Additional TERRONISM INFORMATION or TERRONIST IDENTIFIERS are generated during ENCOUNTERS and the Encounter Management Application (DMA) ${ }^{15}$ uses that information to update records of KNOWN or SOMETED TERRONISTS.
1.31 SCHIZONERS vet against the TEDB to determine if an individual is a possible match to a KNOWN or SOMETED TERRONIST in the TEDB. SCHIZONERS can include federal, state, local, tribal, territorial, or foreign governments and certain private entities. Screening officials include homeland security officers, consular affairs officers, transportation safety personnel, and officials of foreign governments with whom the United States has entered into a TERRONISM SCHIZONING INFORMATION- 號HORINGS IDENTIFIERS are generated pursuant to HSPD-6. Certain Departments and Agencies have components which perform both screening and law enforcement duties. If a

SCREENER believes an individual may be on the Watchlist, the screener contacts the TSC's Terrorist Screening Operations Center (TSSOC). The TSSOC will determine whether the individual the SCREENER has encountered is, in fact, a POSITIVE NOTCH to the individual who is on the Terrorist Watchlist. The TSSOC may also notify the FBI's Counterreversion Division (CTD) that there has been a positive ENCONSTR with a watchlisted subject. TSC's Terrorist Screening Operations Unit (TSSOC) coordinates the appropriate operational response to the ENCONSTR. Based on the TERRIBON INTERNATION made available by the ORIGINSTINE AGENCY, the SCREENER will take action based upon its specific authorities (e.g., requiring additional screening at an airport checkpoint, denying a vise application, determining admissibility into the United States) and follow appropriate ENCONSTR procedures, as set forth in Chapter 5.
1.32 Collection, Nomination, Consolidation and the Use of the Terrorist Watchlist to Perform Screening Processes. The following is a chart depicting the collection, TERRIBIST nomination, consolidation and screening processes:

1.33 The arrows fade inside the TSDH cylinder because not every nomination from NCTC (for international tinendition) or the FBI (for domestic tinendition) is expected from the TSDH to SCREENING (represented by the multi-colonial blocks at the far right of the chart). ${ }^{31}$ For example, certain categories of individuals that do not meet the minimum identifying criteria (see Chapter 2, Section 8) or the MANONASSLE SUPPLIER- standard (see Chapter 3, Section 8) can be watchlined to support immigration and visa screening activities by DHS and DOR (see Chapter 3, Section V) but are not expected to state/fossifelfed SCREENING or foreign partners. Similarly, when ORIGINATIONS provide FRAGMENTARY INFORMATION to NCTC for inclusion in TIDE, such information will not be expected from TIDE to the TSDH, unless the MANON OWG AGENCY believes there is ALVANNABLE SUPPLIER to believe that the individual is a KNOWG or SUSPECTED DISORDINAL PHAGMENYARY INFORMATION is provided to NCTC when it can be further analyzed, connected to existing information, and added to TIDE for export to TSDH because NCTC, and not individual ORIGINATIONS, has access to all the information available to the U.S. Government on a KNOWG or SUSPECTED DISORDIN.

## VII. ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITES FOR THE WATCHLISTING AND SCREENING COMMUNITY

1.34 Definication of roles and responsibilities of NOMINATING AGENCIES, SCREENING, NCTC, and the TSC is critical to provide for an effective and efficient integrated Torvorie Watchlist enterprise. While USPD-6 describes the broad mandate of developing an integrated watchlist system, and the TSC MOC provides a level of detail needed to fulfill that mandate, further clarification is required to ensure there are neither gaps in the nomination process, nor wasteful relandancies.
1.35 Pursuant to USPD-6, Departments and Agencies in the Executive Branch are required, to the extent permitted by law, to provide TINEMINST INFORMATION to NCTC. This process will be accomplished either through direct nomination to NCTC, or through a specific component designated by a Federal Department or Agency head for doing so (e.g., all DCO components are directed to nominate through the FBI, DHS Intelligence and Analysis (IRA) has overnight responsibility for all DHS nominations). Except as detailed in the previous application to expedited nominations (see Paragraphs 1.38 and 1.39), NOMINATING AGENCIES will enhance to provide comprehensive nominations and include the maximum amount of identifying and INDIAN TORY INFORMATION. ${ }^{32}$ NOMINATING REPARENMENTS AND AGENCIES should prioritize

[^0]:    ${ }^{31}$ The Torvorie Screening Database: Annex D to the FBI Memorandum of Understanding with Department of Defense (DoD), signed February 22, 2012, established DoD as a screening agency customer of the TSC. The dashed line in the letter chart represents that DoD is Enabling procedures to receive and use information from the TSDH for its screening personnel.
    ${ }^{32}$ In May 2010, the Depositor asked that NOMINATING AGENCIES "tissues that construction use comprehensive and include the maximum amount of identifying and INDIAN TORY INFORMATION." In 2012, the Interagency Policy Committee (IPC), in coordination with NOMINATING AGENCIES, NCTC and TSC, developed a practical list of data describes that are critical to screening and identity resolution activities. This identity Resolution and Enhancement Data document is available on NCTC's Establishing Community of Tumour points on the East Worldwide Intelligence Communication System (UNICS).

the identification of new KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORISTS who meet the BLACKHAELE SUSPECTOR-QUADR, along with the identifying and DEKIGATORY INFORMATION most useful to watchlisting, and screening effort, as well as assisting in identity resolution.
1.36 Each Department or Agency that nominates a KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST to NCTC for watchlisting is under a continuing obligation to provide NCTC with newly identified DEKIGATORY INFORMATION or excolpatory information obtained by that Department or Agency. Each Department or Agency also has the responsibility to provide NCTC with newly identified identifying and DEKIGATORY INFORMATION obtained from thair Department or Agency, regardless if they were the original NOMINATING AGENCY.
1.37 With the noted exception of the Visa Vigor Program, Departments and Agencies should not nominate KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORISTS to NCTC based on information that they do not originate without first coordinating with the DEKIGATOR.

# VIII. QUALITY CONTROL MEASURES 

1.38 In order to produce and maintain the most reliable and accurate information in TIDP, TSDB, and screening databases, quality control is considered a responsibility of all entities. NOMINATING DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCES must establish and maintain processes, including appropriate training and guidance, to ensure information transmitted to NCTC is consistent with the source of the information.
1.39 HSPD-4 Requirements. HSPD-4 requires the TSC to maintain thorough, accurate, and current information consuming KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORISTS. For watchlisting purposes, "current" means information that the NOMINATING AGENCY reasonably believes is valid and accurate. The requirement that information be current does not necessarily preclude information that is several years old from being included in the TSDB if there is no reason to believe the information may have changed (e.g., information regarding an individual's date of birth or TEERIMIST ACTIVITY was collected 20 years ago but has not been superseded by additional information is still relevant). NOMINATORS should consider the date of the DEKIGATORY INFORMATION in the context of analyzing the overall quality of the date, as well as the severity of the threat, to determine whether the individual warrants watchlisting. The date of the DEKIGATORY INFORMATION may refer to both the date the information is collected (such as a report that was collected 50 years ago) as well as the date of the information that is referenced in the reporting (such as a recent report that references an event that occurred 50 years ago).
1.40 TSC MOU Obligations. Paragraph 15 of the TSC MOU provides that the TSC "will determine, according to criteria established jointly with the entity responsible for each supported system, which supported screening processes will query that entry in the consolidated TERRORIST screening database." Persuant to that paragraph, the TSC is required to "make these determinations based on criteria and procedures developed in coordination with the Parties to this Memorandum and in consultation with the heads of appropriate Federal

UNCLASSIFIED/FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION

Departments and Agencies based on factors, including but not limited to, the following:
1.40.1 the nature of the person's association with TERRORING;
1.40.2 the quality of the data, including credibility, reliability, and extent of corroboration; and,
1.40.3 the extent of uniquely identifying data. . . ${ }^{27}$
1.41 Provide Guidance and Training. Each Agency will provide guidance on the watchlisting business process. Analysts will receive periodic refresher training, as needed.
1.42 NOMINATING AGENCY Procedures. Each NOMINATOR providing international TERRORIST watchlisting nominations to NCTC is responsible for the accuracy of its information and has a continuing responsibility to notify NCTC of any changes that affect the validity or reliability of each information. ${ }^{28}$ NCTC analysts will review each nomination for TERRORIST watchlisting prior to its inclusion into TIDE and its export to the TSE00.
1.43 Each NOMINATING AGENCY should implement processes designed to ensure that nominations are free from errors, that recalled or revised information is reviewed regularly, and that necessary corrections to nominations based on those revisions/retractions are made. NOMINATING AGENCIES should, to the extent possible given the nature of the reporting, verify the accuracy and reliability of the information included in nominations. The following represents the type of processes that each NOMINATING AGENCY shall develop that are tailored to each Agency's particular mission and operational environment:
1.43.1 Develop Adequate Factual Products. Each NOMINATING AGENCY will seek to obtain an much DIAGNATORY INFORMATION and identifying information as practicable concerning the DOWN or EOENCIOU TERRORIST who is being nominated.
1.43.2 Provide Guidance and Training. Each NOMINATING AGENCY will provide guidance on the TERRORIST watchlisting nomination process and ensure that analysts involved in the nomination process are trained on a periodic basis.
1.43.3 Require Quality Assurance Review. Each NOMINATING AGENCY will use a quality assurance process to review nominations for accuracy prior to forwarding the information to NCTC.
1.43.4 Heightened Review for U.S. PERSONS. The nominations of U.S. PERSON require

UNCLASSIFIED/FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION
special considerations and procedures. ${ }^{4}$ See Paragraph 3.15.
1.43.5 U.S. PERSON Determination. NOMINATIONS must take reasonable steps to determine whether an individual is a U.S. PERSON.
1.43.6 U.S. PERSON Review and Confirmation. Nominations of U.S. PERSONS to the Terrorist Watchlist shall be reviewed by the NOMINATING AGENCY'S legal counsel or a designated reviewer to confirm that the BLANDHARLE SCHEDON standard has been met or that the nomination meets an exception to the BLANDHARLE SCHEDON standard, and to ensure that the nomination conforms to Agency specific U.S. PERSON authorities and guidelines.
1.43.7 Reliability and Accuracy Limitations. Nominations will include any limitations on the reliability or accuracy of the information.
1.43.8 Periodic Reviews. The NOMINATING AGENCY will conduct periodic reviews of their nominations of U.S. PERSONS to the Terrorist Watchlist, at minimum on an annual basis, when there is no corresponding FBI investigation to ensure that the U.S. PERSON continues to meet watchlisting criteria.
1.43.9 Redress Procedures. As per the establishment of a formal watchlist redress process (see Chapter 1, Section XI), entities involved in the watchlisting process shall establish internal reviews and redress procedures.
1.44 Each NOMINATIONS AGENCY will have procedures that facilitate the prevention, identification, and correction of any errors in information that is shared as part of the watchlisting process. Procedures will include the review of interactions and/or corrections of information that may have been used to support a nomination. In cases where a retraction or other information has become available, the NOMINATION AGENCY will promptly send a watchlist removal request or modification, as appropriate, to NCTC. Each NOMINATION AGENCY must provide notice of any errors or outdated information to NCTC immediately unless there is an articulated reason why such notification could not be made immediately. NCTC will process and transmit to TBC such corrections upon receipt.
1.45 NCTC Review. In addition to review by NCTC analysis, NCTC will employ a quality control process to ensure that all standards and appropriate procedures have been employed, the data is accurate, and the presentation of the material is clear, concise, and complex with established definitions and conventions. NCTC must also have processes and procedures in place to ensure the information documented in TIDE and provided to the TBC is accurately transcribed. NCTC shall ensure there is a process in place for review and/or auditing of TIDE records.

UNCLASSIFIED/FOO OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION
1.46 TSC Review. TSC personnel will review the nominations received as described in Paragraph 1.56. TSC personnel evaluate whether nominations meet watchfisting standards and weigh, as appropriate, all-severe analysis before accepting or rejecting a nomination. The TSC has a critical role to play in quality control, as the TSC review is the last step before any record (including a biometric nomination where no name is available) is sent to various screening systems. As with NCTC, the TSC should ensure there is a process in place for review and/or auditing of TSC nominations and TSC records.

# IX. NOMINATION PROCEDURES 

1.47 Distinctions between U.S. PERSONI under Executive Order 12333 and Alians under the Incompration and Nationality Act. This Watchfisting Guidance generally adopts the definition of U.S. PERSON from Executive Order 12333 (as amended) for nomination procedures. Executive Order 12333 defines a U.S. PERSON as "A United States citizen, an alien known by the intelligence element concerned to be a permanent resident alien, an unincorporated association substantially composed of United States citizens or permanent resident aliens, or a corporation incorporated in the United States, except for a corporation directed or controlled by a foreign government or governments." The Watchfisting Guidance also contains certain exceptions to the minimum substantive derogatory standards for TRENDROT watchfisting that support immigration and via screening activities by the DHS and DOS to determine whether ineligibilities exist for admission to the United States or via adjudication pursuant to the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). Because the INA defines "alieno" as any person not a citizen or national of the United States, the INA admirability provisions also apply to Lawful Permanent Residents (LPRs), in certain circumstances, who are considered U.S. PERSONS under Executive Order 12333. Consequently, NCTC developed a mechanism in 1930 to identify and distinguish U.S. citizens from non-U.S. citizens in order to further distinguish between "aliens" under the INA and U.S. PERSONS under Executive Order 12333. ${ }^{30}$
1.48 ORIGINATION'S Nominations Procedures. As mentioned in Paragraph 1.26, when an ORIGINATION becomes a NOMINATION, it prepares a nomination document and forwards it to NCTC through the NOMINATOR tool.
1.48.1 As a general rule, NCTC will attach all disseminated communications (sublits or forms) to the TERNDROT identities record as a "source" document, which will be available on NCTC Current or the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System (JWICS) to individuals who have been granted access to 1930.
1.48.2 Because NCTC is the conduit for passing international TERNDRISM INFORMATION to TSC for TERNDRISM screening purposes, there is no longer a need to send watchlist requests to multiple Government Agencies. By sending a Terrorist Watchlist nomination table to NCTC, all potential U.S. Government TERNDRISM screening

responsibilities should be accounted for.
1.48.3 The DQJ has approved a Protocol to govern tERMONICI nominations for its non-FBI components, which requires components to provide the FBI with all tERMONIH INFORMATION. ${ }^{17}$ The FBI is responsible for submitting watchfitting nominations based on information received from other DQI components pursuant to the FBI's nomination procedure.
1.48.4 DHS has designated the Under Secretary for G\&A as the Executive Agent for DHS' centralized tERMONICI watchfitting process and he/she shall be responsible for providing a DHS wide-mechanism for nominating all identifying or tERMONICIHY INFORMATION about KNOWt or SUPPLIED TERMINISTs to TIDE. DHS G\&A is also responsible for providing training/certification programs to the components.
1.49 In providing information to NCTC for inclusion into TIDE, the ORIGINATION is responsible for determining whether it may, by law, provide the information to NCTC, in accordance with section 1021(2)(6) of INTPA. This information shall be provided with any applicable caveats or dissemination controls, which will be reflected in TIDE. The biographic and biometric identifiers derived from this information will be deemed U/FOOD for passage to TIDIS unless the ORIGINATION designates them as "TIDE Restricted," as outlined in Addendum 81 to the TSC MOC.
1.50 NCTC Actions and Processes. NCTC reviews TERMINIST nominations from Federal Departments or Agencies (NOMINATION) as described in Paragraph 1.28.
1.51 In determining whether an individual is a KNOWt or SUPPLIED TERMINIST, NCTC will rely on the designation of "KNOWt TERMINIST" provided by the NOMINATION as presumptively valid. This presumption can be overcome if NCTC has specific and credible information within its possession that such designation is not appropriate, at which point NCTC will provide such information to the NOMINATION.
1.52 In reviewing whether to include the TERMINING INFORMATION about the KNOWt or SUPPLIED TERMINIST in TIDE, NCTC reviews the quality of information. The totality of information is evaluated based on the experience of the reviewer, and the facts and rational inferences that may be drawn from those facts, including past conduct, current actions, and credible intelligence concerning future conduct. As part of this review, NCTC will determine if the information pertains to, or is related to, TERMINING. TIDE includes TERMINING INFORMATION on KNOWt or SUPPLIED TERMINIST and may include additional TERMINING INFORMATION beyond what meets the minimum substantive derogatory and identifying criteria required for nominations to the TIDIS, as described in Paragraph 1.24. Upon conclusion of NCTC's review, NCTC will either accept or reject the nomination:

    UNCLASSIFIED/FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION
# UNCLASSIFIED/FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION 

1.32.1 Accept Nomination. If a nomination contains TERROBIUM INFORMATION, NCTC will create or enhance the associated TIDE record with the data contained in the nomination. If the minimum substantive derogatory and identifying criteria are met, NCTC will forward the TEORONST IDENTIFIERS to the TSC for placement in TSDB with the NONNATORY watchlist recommendation.
1.32.2 Reject Nomination. If a nomination does not contain TERROBIUM INFORMATION, NCTC may reject the nomination. NCTC will review rejected nominations and search holdings for additional data that may support a TERROBIUM INFORMATION finding. If no information is found to support the nomination, NCTC will notify the NONNATIQ AGENCY of the rejection.
1.33 Types of records in TIDE. There are two types of records in TIDE:
1.33.1 TERROBIST Records. The vast majority of records in TIDE are for KNOWN or SUSPECTED international TERROBISTS. These records are labeled "TERROBISTS." Only a small percentage of TERROBIST records in TIDE concern U.S. FLORONS.
1.33.2 Non-TERROBIST Records. A small percentage of records in TIDE are identified and labeled "Non-TERROBISTS." ${ }^{26}$ These records are generally of familial family members or associates of KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERROBISTS and assist DHS and DHS in, for example, adjudicating visas and immigration processing, or assist the IC in tracking KNOWN TERROBISTS. These "Non-TERROBISTS" include:
1.33.2.1 Alien Spouses and Children of TERROBISTS. Based on section 212(a)(7)(E)(2)(E) of the INA, alien spouses and children of TERROBISTS may be inadvisable to the United States. ${ }^{27}$ TIDE exports records pertaining to alien spouses and children of alien international TERROBISTS (also known as TIDE Category Code 17) to support immigration and visa screening activities by DHS and DHS;
1.33.2.2 Other Relatives. TIDE also includes "non-TERROBIST" records of individuals who have a close relationship to a KNOWN or SUSPECTED international

1.56.2.1.7 Tipoff Asamblea Counterterrorien Information Control System (TACTICS).
1.56.2.2 Reject Nomination. If a nomination lacks either the minimum substantive derogatory criteria or the minimum identifying information, and is not an exception to those requirements (e.g., TIDE Category Codes 50 or 99 as described in Pampaph 1.53.2), TSC will reject the nomination and notify NCTC directly of its determination or coordinate with NCTC to notify the NOMINATOR of its determination. Records nominated to TIDE that are ineligible for TORNORST watchlisting may remain in TIDE until additional information is obtained to warrant either watchlisting or removal from TIDE. NCTC analysts will review allsource information for additional identifying or substantive OXIDICATORY INFORMATION. If additional information is discovered, NCTC will enhance the TIDE record and submit the record to TSC for inclusion in the TSDR. The TIDE record will be reviewed again by the TSC to determine whether it is eligible for watchlisting in TSDR and export to certain supported screening systems. ${ }^{11}$
1.57 The number of TSC's supported systems will continue to grow as TSC, DHS, and DOS repaid their domestic and international outreach efforts and finalize additional agreements to exchange TORNORSHS OXIDICHNIC INFORMATION. TSC has modified the TSDR so that certain customers may query the TSDR remotely instead of receiving exports of TSDR data to their own systems.
1.58 Expedited Nomination Procedures for Individual Nominations. If svijent circumstance exist (ineminent travel and/or threat) where an individual nomination into the TSDR needs to be expedited after normal duty hours, a NOMINATOR, with coordination from NCTC, may contact the TSC's TSOC directly. If a NOMINATOR coordinated with NCTC, the nomination will be received by the TSC via the BRQ in TSDR and the TSOC Watch Commander will coordinate with a NDIU Senior Analyst to process the nomination. A NOMINATOR may also contact the TSC directly and provide all relevant information using the following process:
1.58.1 The NOMINATOR must first contact the TSOC at 860 (tribus) (still free number) or at 571 (tribus).
1.58.2 The NOMINATOR will be instructed by a TSOC Specialist on how to telephonically complete a Terrorist Screening Center Expedited Nomination Request Form.
1.58.3 In addition to basic identifying information, the NOMINATOR will be requested to provide a 2407 point of contact should the KNOWN or SCEPTITED TORNORST be encountered by a SCREENER.

nature of the threat involved, not to exceed 30 days but may be renewed for additional 30-day periods upon written approval of the Depaíses or Principals Committee. A THU is valid until the threat no longer exists. To the extent that such threat recedes or is otherwise mitigated prior to the expiration of 30 days or during any extension approved by the Depaíses or Principals Committee, TSC and NCTC and members of the watchfisting community shall immediately request of the Depaíses or Principals Committee to downgrade these THUs to their original or appropriate status. All threatbased records transmitted through automated mechanisms (i.e., WLS, CCD) will include a "THU indicator" at the message level to differentiate this category of records from non-THU records and to provide the THU directive for which the record is upgraded.
1.59.4 Until such time as the Depaíses or Principals provide additional, written guidance, OKN will defer visa actions with respect to these expedited upgrades in watchlist status.
1.59.5 Departments and Agencies will advise the Depaíses or Principals of other consequences that may result from a change in watchlist status and seek guidance as to how to proceed.
1.59.6 After these categorical moves are accomplished or renewed, there will be an expedited procedure for the review of all c. t. minates that are part of the THU to ensure their watchfisting status is appropriate (including whether continued categorical watchfisting may be warranted based on the nature of the threat).
1.60 Arbitration of Watchfisting Bicpates. If a NOMINATOR wishes to dispute TSC's watchfisting determination, it may contact NCTC (for international TOMINIST nominations) to discuss the watchfisting status and/or submit additional substantive derogatory and identifying information to support its initial nomination. Additional information provided to NCTC by a NOMINATOR will be passed to the TSC for review and final watchfisting determination. In the case of an FBI dispute over the TSC's watchfisting determination of an international TOMINIST's nomination, a case agent must contact the TSC.
1.61 In the case of domestic TOMINIST nominations, if the FBI wishes to dispute TSC's watchfisting determination, it may contact the TSC to discuss the watchfisting status and/or submit additional substantive derogatory and identifying information to support its initial nomination.

## X. PROCEDURES TO REMOVE AN INDIVIDUAL FROM THE WATCHLIST

1.62 A NOMINATOR decking to remove an international TOMINIST identity record previously nominated to TIDF, should contact NCTC and provide written justification for the request. NCTC will promptly process the request when received. NCTC will be the final arbiter of whether the identity is removed from TIDF, and TSC will be the final arbiter of whether tOMINIST ERCUTIOUS are removed from TIDF.
UNCLASSIFIED/FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION
1.63 If the NOMINATOR requesting removal of an international TORNOMOT identity record from TIDE is the only NOMINATOR to have provided information on that record, the removal request will be immediately processed by NCTC. The removal information is then sent to the TSC, which, in turn, makes a determination regarding removal of the TORNOMOT identity from the TSDB.
1.64 If multiple NOMINATORs have provided information on an international TORNOMOT identity record, NCTC will coordinate with all relevant parties in an attempt to reach a consensus on the TORNOMOT identity's most appropriate watchlisting status.
1.64.1 If the multiple NOMINATORS arrive at a consensus that the watchlisted identity is not reasonably suspected of engaging in TORNOMON and/or TORNOMOT ACTIVITY, or an applicable exception, the identity is removed from the TSDB and TIDE. In certain circumstances, NCTC may retain records in TIDE to prevent inappropriate rewatchlisting.
1.64.2 If the multiple NOMINATORS cannot arrive at a consensus regarding the watchlisting status of an identity, TSC may decide to remove the identity from the TSDB, but NCTC may retain the identity in TIDE.
1.64.3 For cases in which the FBI has conducted an investigation on an individual (independently nominated by another NOMINATOR) and has concluded that the watchlisted individual is not a KNOWN or NOMINATOR TORNOMOT, the individual may be removed from the TSDB. ${ }^{36}$ In such cases, the TORNOMOT INDIVIDUALS from the FBI's investigation may be used to supplement the TIDE record.
1.65 The FBI will review domestic TORNOMOT identity removal requests according to applicable FBI procedures.
1.66 TSC has an established, on-going process to review every record in the TSDB in accordance with Paragraph (R)(b) of the TSC MOD and its mission under USPD-6 to maintain the most thorough, accurate, and current information in the TSDB. If TSC determines that the watchlisting standards are not met for an individual record, TSC will remove the record from the TSDB, in coordination with the NOMINATING AGENCY.

# XI. REDRESS PROCEDURES 

1.67 In January 2005, the TSC established a formal watchlist redress process that allows Agencies

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{36}$ After an FBI determination that the individual is not a KNOWN or NOMINATOR TORNOMOT, NCTC may determine based on a NOMINATOR'S information application, that the individual should remain in TIDE as exactly that have been fully edited and placed out by accessed against (TIDE) Category Code 100, the individual be watchlisted based upon the NOMINATOR'S independent determination that the individual is a KNOWN or NOMOTED TORNOMOT or that the individual warrants watchlisting based upon an exception to the NONENVERLE DUPREEM standard.

that use TSDR data during a TUMORUM screening process to refer individuals' complaints to the TSC if it appears the complaints may be related to the watchlisting process. The goal of the watchlist redress process is to provide for timely and fair review of individuals' complaints and to identify and correct any errors in the TSDR.
1.68 The watchlist redress process is a multi-Agency process involving the DHS, TSC, NCTC, NOMINATIONS, and SCIENCIES. On September 19, 2007, Agencies participating in the watchlist redress process executed the Redress MOU to set forth a coordinated redress process to respond to individual complaints about adverse screening experiences. ${ }^{2}$
1.69 TSC's Redress Office is responsible for receiving, tracking, and researching watchlist-related complaints that SCRADREN refer to TSC. For each redress complaint received, the Redress Office conducts an in-depth analysis to determine if the person's complaint is related to a TSDR record, including a determination of whether the complaint is the watchlisted individual or merely a near-match to a watchlist record. If the complaint is the watchlisted individual, the TSC's Redress Office will determine whether the watchlisted individual still meets all the watchlisting criteria.
1.70 For each complaint, the TSC Redress Office coordinates with the NOMINATION (via NCTC when the NOMINATION is not the PHS), who assists in the evaluation of the complaint to ensure the most current, accurate, and thorough information available is used to review the person's watchlist status. Where appropriate and warranted by the current information and applicable criteria, a person's watchlist status may be adjusted (e.g., downgraded from the No Fly to Selecter List or the person's identity may be removed entirely from the TSDR). If the redress complaint was referred to the TSC from the DHS Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (DHS TRIP), the individual's adjusted watchlist status will be provided to DHS TRIP for instance of an appropriate response.
1.71 DHS TRIP is a single point of contact for individuals who have inquiries or seek resolution regarding difficulties they experience during their travel screening or inspection at. For example, transportation hubs like airports, or when crossing U.S. borders. The DHS TRIP website is http://dhs.gov/dhs. DHS TRIP ensures a thorough review is completed by consulting and sharing information with other DHS Components and other Agencies, as appropriate, to address the issues identified by the complainant.

## XII. PERIODIC REVIEW OF THE WATCHLISTING GUIDANCE

1.72 This Watchlisting Guidance shall be reviewed no less than every two years following the conclusion of the previous review, or as needed.

# CHAPTER 2: MINIMUM IDENTIFYING CRITERIA 

## I. HOMETRIC NOMINATIONS

2.1 Biometric information refers to the measurable biological (anatomical or physiological) and behavioral characteristics that can be used for recognition. Examples include facial photographs, biographies, iris scans, digital images, latent prints, DNA and gait. A biometric is sufficient to meet the minimum identifying criteria for nominations to the NCTC's TIDE and/or the TSC's TSDB, provided that the nomination also meets the minimum substantive derogatory criteria, or use of the exceptions. Biometric nominations without minimum biographic information will be provided only to those SENZYMES that have the technical capability to screen against or otherwise make assessments using the biometrics. Nonordinanding the above, all NOMINATORS are encouraged to include all available associated biographic information with any biometric nomination.

## II. MINIMUM BIOGRAPHIC NOMINATION REQUIREMENT

2.2 TIDE. NOMINATORS shall provide NCTC, for inclusion into TIDE, FRAGMENTARY INFORMATION that suggests an individual may have a mean to TERMOROM and/or TERMINIST ACTIVITIES and any additional information that will facilitate identification of these individuals. Nominations to TIDE under this section will be considered for inclusion in the TSDB if the NOMINATING AGENCY believes there is MARINAble SUPPLIÓN to believe that the individual is a KNOWNAF SUPPLICTED TERMINIST.
2.2.1 Nominations of individuals based on FRAGMENTARY INFORMATION who fail to meet the minimum identifying criteria for nomination to TSDB should be provided to NCTC for inclusion in TIDE when there is BIOGRAFORY INFORMATION suggesting that the individual is associated with TERMOROM and the NOMINATING AGENCY determines that there are sufficient identifiers for possibly facilitating a match to existing TIDE records. Unless otherwise directed, NOMINATING AGENCIES should prioritize the nominations of individuals who satisfy the minimum identifying criteria before addressing nominations based on FRAGMENTARY INFORMATION.
2.3 SCHRENCH DIScretion. As appropriate, SCHRENCHS have the discretion to decide not to include in their screening systems common names received from the TSDB, where insufficient identifying information exists for identification.
2.4 TSDB. Nominations to the TSDB must include a last name. NOMINATING AGENCIES should also provide any additional identifying information available. In addition to a last name, nominations must include:
2.4.1 first name;

UNCLASSIFIED/FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION
# UNCLASSIFIED/FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION 

2.4.2 Or any one of the following additional identifiers:

| 2.4.2.1 | Full date of birth (sight digit "nun/dd/yyyy" format); |
| :--: | :--: |
| 2.4.2.2 | Passport number (with or without country of issuance); |
| 2.4.2.3 | Unique identifying numbers such as allen registration numbers, visa numbers, and social security numbers; |
| 2.4.2.4 | Telephone number(s) ${ }^{\text {® }}$; |
| 2.4.2.5 | E-mail address(es) ${ }^{\text {® }} ;$ |
| 2.4.2.6 | I-borne plate number(s). |
| 2.4.3 Or any two of the following additional identifiers ${ }^{\text {® }}$ : |  |
| 2.4.3.1 | Country of citizenship, if different from place of birth; |
| 2.4.3.2 | Place of birth (city or country), if different from country of citizenship; |
| 2.4.3.3 | Cirea or partial date of birth (partial: e.g., 1960; or range: e.g., 1960-1965); |
| 2.4.3.4 | Full name of an immediate family member (e.g., parent, spouse, sibling, or children); |
| 2.4.3.5 | Occupation or current employer; |
| 2.4.3.6 | Specific degrees received; |
| 2.4.3.7 | Schools attended; |
| 2.4.3.8 | Physical identifiers such as race, height, or weight; |
| 2.4.3.9 | Unique physical identifiers such as scars, marks or tatloos; |
| 2.4.3.10 | Street address or other sufficiently specific location information. |

${ }^{\text {® }}$ Only unclassified phone numbers that are authorized for passage to TSC pursuant to Paragraph Tpxt of Addendum B to the TSC MDU will be included in TSDR. See Appendix 4. Unclassified phone numbers will only be provided to those or/extentry that have the technical capability to receive this date.
${ }^{\text {® }}$ Only unclassified email addresses that are authorized for passage to TSC pursuant to Paragraph Text of Addendum B of the TSC MDU will be included in TSDR. See Appendix A. Unclassified email addresses will only be provided to those or/extentry that have the technical capability to receive this date.
${ }^{\text {® }}$ As required here, there must be two distinct identifiers that may be sufficiently specific to account for the large number of possible matches common identifiers may produce. For example, if one identifier is either common (e.g., physical identifiers), the other identifier must be more specific to parent/do screening official to successfully match a record with an individual. As a further example, a combination with the last same bond as Ritan, location listed as Kabel, Afghanistan, and occupation listed as a father alone would be insufficient for screening purposes because it is highly unlikely a successful match could be made against such date. However, a combination with the same bond as K Ritan, location listed as residence of 125 baselary Ritan, Kabel, Afghanistan, and occupation listed as a father at TSC Bakery, would be sufficient for screening purposes.

III. MINIMUM BIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION REQUIRED FOR EXCEPTIONS TO THE MINIMUM SUBSTANTIVE DEROGATORY STANDARDS FOR TERRORIST WATCHLISTING
2.3 There are certain exceptions to the minimum substantive derogatory standards for TRANSMITT watchfisting that support immigration and visa screening activities by DDS and DDS. ${ }^{20}$ Examples of these categories of records include, but may not be limited to, records relating to an individual who has a defined relationship with the KNOWN or RESPECTED (TERRORIST), but whose involvement with the KNOWN or RESPECTED (TERRORIST?) activities is unknown (TIDE Category Code 50) and those with insufficient DERIGA EARY INFORMATION ( 0 ) must the MEASUREDLE RESPONDON standard for watchfisting (TIDE Category Code 99).
2.6 NOMINATING AGENCIES should provide all additional identifying information available. All nominations under this section must include a full name (first name, last name) and one of the following identifiers:

2.6.1 Full date of birth;
2.6.2 Full passport number (with or without country of issuance);
2.6.3 Unique identifying numbers such as alien registration numbers, visa numbers, and social security account numbers;

## CHAPTER 3: MINIMUM SUBSTANTIVE DEROGATORY CRITERIA

## I. INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE

3.1 TBC issued an undated U.S. Government Protocol Regarding Terrorist Nominations on February 25, 2009, that included an appendix identifying the minimum substantive derogatory criteria for acceptance of KNOWN or SUBSTITUO TORNINIST nominations into the TSDB. Based on the attempted terms attack of December 25, 2009, the Watchlining Guidance was reviewed to determine whether adjustments were needed. The revised guidance was approved by the White House Deposits Committee on May 25, 2010 and issued to the watchlining community on July 16, 2010, after a multi-agency classification review.
3.2 This Chapter of the Watchlining Guidance has been updated to reflect the watchlining community's experiences with the Guidance since (essence in July of 2010 by the Deposits Committee. One of the more notable changes of this updated version of the Watchlining Guidance is the restructuring of instances for when PARIETALARIZED DEROGATORY INFORMATION is required. Another notable change includes the re-introduction of guidance relative to the TORNINIST facilitators or supporters from an earlier version of the Watchlining Guidance and the inclusion of additional exceptions to the minimum substantive derogatory standards for TORNINIST watchlining that support immigration and visa screening activities of the DOS and DHS.

## II. REASONABLE SURFICION

3.3 For purposes of watchlining an individual to the TSDB, the NONINATOR should determine whether they is REASONABLE SURFICION that an individual is a KNOWN or SUBSTITU O DORNINIST. ${ }^{4}$

3.4 REASONABLE SURFICION. To meet the REASONABLE SURFICION standard, the NONINATOR, based on the totality of the circumstances, must rely upon articulable intelligence or information which, taken together with rational informats from those facts, reasonably warrants a determination that an individual is known or suspected to be or has been knowingly engaged in conduct constituting, in preparation for, is aid of, or related to TORNINIST and/or TORNINIST ACTIVITIES. There must be an objective factual basis for the NONINATOR to believe that the individual is a KNOWN or SUBSTITU O DORNINIST. Mere guanues or humbles are not sufficient to contribute a REASONABLE SURFICION that an individual is a KNOWN or SUBSTITU TORNINIST. Reporting of suspicious activity alone that does not meet the REASONABLE SURFICION standard on both bereits is not a sufficient basis to watchlist an individual. The facts, however, given fair consideration, should sensibly lead to the conclusion that an individual is, or has, engaged in TORNINIST and/or TORNINIST ACTIVITIES.

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{4}$ To instance when REASONABLE SURFICION is not found, NONINATOR should also determine whether the individual should be nominated to support immigration and visa screening by DHS and DOS (see Chapter 3, Section V).

    UNCLASSIFIED/FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION
UNCLASSIFIED/FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION
3.3 Das Weight. In determining whether a KAAGNANLE SUPPCION exists, due weight should be given to the specific reasonable inferences that a NOMINATOR is entitled to draw from the facts in light of his/her experience and not on unfounded suspicions or banches. Although irrefutable evidence or concrete facts are not necessary, to be reasonable, suspicion should be as clear and as fully developed as circumstances permit. For additional guidance regarding the nomination of U.S. PERSONS, see Paragraph 2.15.
3.6 NOMINATORS shall not nominate an individual based on source reporting that NOMINATING personnel identify as, or know to be, unreliable or not credible. Single source information, including but not limited to "walk-in","write-in", or postings on social media sites, however, should not automatically be discounted merely because of the manner in which it was received. Instead, the NOMINATING AGENCY should evaluate the credibility of the source, as well as the nature and specificity of the information, and nominate even if that source is uncorrelevated, assuming the information supports a KAAGNANLE SUPPCION that the individual is a KNOWN or SUPPCITED IORNMENT or there is another basis for watchfisting the individual.
3.7 Criteria and Data Quality. To demonstrate that the nomination has sufficient indicis of reliability to support a KAAGNANLE SUPPCION determination, NOMINATING AGENCIES should incorporate processes designed to ensure that nominations are free of errors, and to the extent possible given the nature of the reporting, have not come from sources known or determined to be unreliable. NOMINATING AGENCIES should, to the extent possible, verify the accuracy and reliability of the information included in nominations. In addition to ensuring that nominations are free from errors, NOMINATING AGENCIES should implement procedures designed to ensure that recalled or revised information is reviewed regularly, and that necessary corrections to nominations based on those revisions/retractions are made.
3.8 PARTICULARIZED BEBECASTORY INFORMATION. PARTICULARIZED BEBECASTORY INFORMATION is the type of information relied on to determine whether KAAGNANLE SUPPCION is met. This is information that demonstrates the nature of an individual's or group's association with PERSONS and/or TEMPORAL ACTIVITIES that is descriptive and specific to an event or activity, and is more than a label. For example, "Subject X provides false-mean documentation for Al-Qaida operations" is PARTICULARIZED BEBECASTORY INFORMATION, whereas "Subject Y is a supporter," standing alone, is not considered PARTICULARIZED BEBECASTORY INFORMATION.
3.9 Potential Behavioral Indicators. In making a KAAGNANLE SUPPCION determination, NOMINATORS should consider behavioral indicators known to be associated with particular KNOWN or SUPPCITED IORNMENTS. The following is a list of a few examples of those indicators. It is not an exclusive list and it includes activity that may have innocent explanations wholly unrelated to TEMPORAL. Furthermore, some activities conducted by U.S. PERSONS or activities taking place within the United States, may be an exercise of rights guaranteed by the First Amendment. Watchfisting an individual for engaging solely in

# UNCLASSIFIED/FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION
# UNCLASSIFIED/FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION 

constitutionally protected activities is prohibited. ${ }^{41}$ For these reasons, it is critical that each of these activities-as with all possible indicators of TERMONIST ACTIVITY-not be judged in isolation. Each must be viewed in the context in which it occurs and considered in combination with all other known information to ensure that any termination based in whole or in part on this behavior compents with the standards set forth above:
3.9.1 Attendance at training camps known to the IC as facilitating TERMONIST ACTIVITIES ${ }^{42}$;
3.9.2 Attendance at schools/Institutions identified by the IC as teaching an ideology that includes the justification of the unlawful use of violence or violent extremism;
3.9.3 Repeated contact with individuals identified by the IC as teaching or opposing an ideology that includes the justification of the unlawful use of violence or violent extremism; or,
3.9.4 Travel for no known lawful or legitimate purpose to a locus of TERMONIST ACTIVITY.

## III. KNOWN TERMONISTS

3.10 Definitions.
3.10.1 KNOWN TERMONIST. A KNOWN TERMONIST is an individual whom the U.S. Government knows is engaged, has been engaged, or who intends to engage in TERMONIST and/or TERMONIST ACTIVITY, including an individual (a) who has been charged, arrested, indicted, or convicted for a crime related to TERMONIST by U.S. Government or foreign government authorities; or (b) identified as a TERMONIST or member of a designated foreign terrorist organization pursuant to statum, Executive Order or international legal obligation pursuant to a United Nations Security Council Resolution.
3.10.2 TERMONISTS and/or TERMONIST ACTIVITIES. In general, TERMONIST and/or TERMONIST ACTIVITIES are acts that: (a) involve violent acts or acts dangerous to human life, property, or infrastructure that may be a violation of U.S. law, or may have been, if those acts were committed in the United States; and, (b) appear intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population, influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion, or affect the conduct of government by mass destruction, assassination, kidnapping, or hostage-taking. This includes activities that facilitate or support

3.11.2 Individuals Identified as TERRORISTs Pursuant to a United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) Concerning Al-Qaida and Associated Individuals and Entities. Under UNSCR resolution 1287 (1999), modified and strengthened by subsequent resolutions, including resolutions 1321 (2000), 1390 (2002), 1445 (2003), 1526 (2004), 1617 (2005), 1725 (2006), 1822 (2008), 1904 (2009), and resolution 1989 (2011), sanctions measures now apply to designated individuals and entities associated with Al-Qaida, wherever located. The names of the targeted individuals and entities are placed on the Al-Qaida Sanctions List. ${ }^{47}$ Under the UNSCR sanctions regime, the United States has an international legal obligation to prevent the entry into or transk through its territory of designated individuals listed on the Al-Qaida Sanctions List. ${ }^{48}$ NONFORTORS should regularly check the Al-Qaida Sanctions List as individuals are added and dropped as new information becomes available.
3.11.4 Individuals Identified as TERRORISTs Pursuant to the National Intelligence Priorities Framework of Counterterrorism. Members of groups (not support entities) that are identified on the National Intelligence Priorities Framework of
Counterterrorism, (NIPF-CT) are presumed to meet the NONFORTALS SUPPORT standards so long as the group name is not just a regional or activity-based characterization. Nested associations each as janitorial, repair, or delivery services of commercial goods do not meet the NONFORTAL SUPPORT standards.

## IV. SUSPECTED TERRORISTS

3.12 Definition.
3.12.1 A SUSPECTED TERRORIST is an individual who is NONFORTALY SUPPORT to be, or has been, engaged in conduct contributing, in preparation for, in aid of, or related to TERRORIST and/or TERRORIST ACTIVITIES based on an articulaible and NONFORTALY SUPPORT.

regarding the context of the relationship that gives rise to a KAASINABLE SUPPCION that the individual is engaging or has engaged in conduct constituting, in preparation for, in aid of, or related to TERMORISM and/or TERMINIST ACTIVITIES. Neutral associations such as janitorial, repair, or delivery services of commercial goods are not sufficient. Information about the peribent activities of the KNOWN or SUPPLCTED TERMINIST, TERMINIST call or network should be included in the nomination. These nominations should include context or content to demonstrate the membership, association, or affiliation to the KNOWN or SUPPLCTED TERMINIST, TERMINIST call or network. Individuals who merely "may be" members, associates or affiliates to a terrorist organization may not be accepted into the TSDR unless the KAASINABLE SUPPCION standard is met and PARTICULARIZED INDUCAYORY INFORMATION accompanies the nomination.
3.13.4.1 Inferences that Support KAASINABLE SUPPCION. KAASINABLE SUPPCION may be rationally inferred from the context of the relationship with the KNOWN or SUPPLCTED TERMINIST. The following factors should be considered when determining whether KAASINABLE SUPPCION may be inferred:
3.13.4.1.1 The nature of the activity engaged in with the KNOWN or SUPPLCTED TERMINIST;
3.13.4.1.2 The frequency, duration, or manner of their contact;
3.13.4.1.3 A close, continuing, or direct relationship with a KNOWN or SUPPLCTED TERMINIST that reasonably suggests the individual is knowingly involved in or willfully supporting the KNOWN or SUPPLCTED TERMINIST'S TERMINIST ACTIVITIES; or,
3.13.4.1.4 Other malveolent or illicit factors that can be articulated that would support a REARINABLE SUPPCION that the individual is engaging in TERMINISM and/or TERMINIST ACTIVITIES.
3.13.5 Individuals Identified as TERMINIST Facilitators. TERMINIST facilitators are presented to meet the KAASINABLE SUPPCION standard. The nomination should include PARTICULARIZED INDUCAYORY INFORMATION concerning the type of "facilitation" involved and the role of the facilitator when this information is known. Individuals who are considered facilitators include, but are not limited to, financial, document forgers, travel facilitators, money banditons, and arms merchants. There must be KAASINABLE SUPPCION that the facilitator knew that his or her actions would aid in the furtherance of TERMINISM and/or TERMINIST ACTIVITIES.
3.13.5.1 Criminal Activity Supporting TERMINISM. IT Intelligence or information indicates that the individual is engaging in criminal activity related to smuggling, providing safe houses, feaging documents, or any other support to TERMINISTE or terrorist groups. SOMINATORYs should presume that the individual is knowingly engaging in criminal activity that supports TERMINISM and/ or TERMINIST
ACTIVITIES. In these circumstances, BLADINABLE SUPPLIEN is based on the TERROBEST criminal activity and should be described in the nomination.
3.13.6 Individuals who heate Others in Commit Acts of TERROBES. ${ }^{31}$ Incling an individual to commit an act of TERROBEN and/or TERROBEST ACTIVITIES under circumstances that indicate an intention to cause death or serious bodily harm is considered engaging in TERROBEST ACTIVITY and is sufficient to meet the BLADINABLE SUPPLIEN standard. The nomination should include PHYSICAL-ARGEO-DERIGAUTERY INFORMATION concerning the type of "incitement" involved and the role of the individual when this information is known. Normally, speech will not rise to the level of "incling" unless there is a clear link between the speech and an actual effect to undertake the TERROBEST ACTIVITY. The individual may have incited TERROBEST ACTIVITY, even if a terrorist attack does not actually occur (e.g., because an attempt to commit such activity is thwarted). Speech advocating a violent or dangerous TERROBEST ACTIVITY is incitement if such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action. ${ }^{32}$
3.13.7 Individuals Who Solve Others in Engage in TERROBEST ACTIVITIES. In an individual capacity or as a member of an organization, any individual who solicits another to engage in a TERROBEST ACTIVITY and/or for membership in a terrorist organization is considered to be engaging in TERROBEST ACTIVITY. Nominations that include PHYSICAL-ARGEO-DERIGAUTERY INFORMATION-concerning the type of solicitation involved and the role of the individual are sufficient to meet the BLADINABLE SUPPLIEN standard. An individual may fail outside the scope of engaging in the solicitation of an individual for membership in a terrorist organization if there is information that demonstrates that the individual did not know and should not have reasonably known that the organization was a terrorist organization.
3.13.8 Individuals Identified as Sympathizers and Supportors of a Designated Terrorist Organization. ${ }^{33}$ Sympathizers and supporters of a designated terrorist organization (DTIO) (see Paragraph 3.11.2) may be watchlisted when the BLADINABLE SUPPLIEN standard is not, and the nomination includes PHYSICAL-ARGEO-DERIGAUTERY INFORMATION-concerning the how the individual's activities warrant watchfisting, as opposed to information about why the organization is a DTO.
3.13.8.1 A sympathizer or supporter of TERROBEN should be nominated if the support is operational in nature. If support is merely ideological, the individual should not be nominated.

3.13.9 Individuals Identified as FOREIGN FIGITERS. FOREIGN FIGITERS are defined as nationals of one country who travel or attempt to travel to another country to participate in TERRORING and/or TERRORIST ACTIVITIES, and to the extent possible, the nomination should include PARTICULARIZED ORIGINATIONS INFORMATION. Before/or that qualifies as PARTICULARIZED ORIGINATIONS INFORMATION is the travel to a foreign country to participate in TERRORING and/or TERRORIST ACTIVITIES.
3.13.9.1 A person is not considered a FOREIGN FIGITER when he or she traveled from Country A to Country B for non-TERRORIST reasons (e.g., annifing in school), inferences that someone in a FOREIGN FIGITER may not be drawn solely from biographic facts that indicate a person was born in one country and is found in a different country and suspected to be participating in TERRORING and/or TERRORIST ACTIVITIES.
3.13.10 Special Consideration for Individuals Involved with TERRORIST-Associated Weapons. Individuals who possess, handle, use, manufacture, self, or transfer Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDG), Explosively Formed Penetrators (EFP), Radiological Dispersion Devices (RDD), or improvised chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) devices, are presumed to meet the RESIDENCE, SUPPLIED- standard due to the inherently dangerous nature of these items or when it can reasonably be inferred from the content that there is a connection to TERRORING and/or TERRORIST ACTIVITIES (e.g., Iraq, presence of other KNOWS or SUPPLIED TERRORISTs, previous attacks on or threats to U.S. Forests).
3.13.11 Targets of Reids Conducted by the U.S. Military or the Intelligence Community. RESIDENCE SUPPLIED- is presumed where an individual was identified as the target of a raid to disrupt a FTO. When an individual is identified by discovery of information found during the course of such a raid conducted by the U.S. Military or the IC, however, RESIDENCE SUPPLIED is met where the available PARTICULARIZED ORIGINATIONS INFORMATION explains why he or she can be reasonably suspected of engaging or having engaged in conduct constituting, in preparation for, in aid of, or related to TERRORING and/or TERRORIST ACTIVITY. If there is no PARTICULARIZED ORIGINATIONS INFORMATION in the individual for whom information was discovered during the raid, he or she should not be nominated.
3.13.12 Individuals Identified as TERMOMYs via Documentation or Media Exploitation Efforts. Any individuals identified in documents or media otherwise captured by U.S. or allied forces or obtained from a NONSORTING AGENCY must have a connection to TERRORING and/or TERRORIST ACTIVITIES in order to be nominated to the Terrorist Watchlist. RESIDENCE SUPPLIED for an individual to be nominated from document and media exploitation (DOMCE) materials may be established either by the content or context of the DOMCE, or other sources. Nominations under this section must include PARTICULARIZED ORIGINATIONS INFORMATION. For example, RESIDENCE SUPPLIED for watchlisting can be met based on the acquisition of documents/media identifying a person from the counterterrorism operation that targeted the residence of Al-Qaida

leader Usama Sin Laden on May 2, 2011. ${ }^{38}$ Likewise, individuals listed on a roster of an SED self could be nominated solely on the presence of their name on the list. An identity from a captured passport, however, would only be watchlisted if additional reporting documents RUANNARLE SOMICON to believe that the individual is connected to TORROROMA and/or TORRONST ACTIVITY.
3.13.13 LONG WOLVES. Because the focus is on the individual's TORROROMA-related conduct, "LONG WOLF" TORRONSTS should be nominated when PARTICULARIZED/REFERATORY INFORMATION and their actions support a HAAR/NARLE SOMICON that they are engaged in, or have engaged in, TORROROMA and/or TORRONST ACTIVITY. No present known affiliation with a terror group, organization, or cell is required but prior affiliations, if they exist, may be taken into account for supporting a rational inference that the individual is reasonably suspected of engaging in TORROROMA and/or TORRONST ACTIVITY.

# V. EXCEPTIONS TO SUPPORT IMMIGRATION AND VISA SCREENING ACTIVITIES BY DHS AND DOS 

3.14 TSDB Minimum Substantive Derogatory Exceptions to Support Immigration and Visa Screaming Activities by the DHS and DOS. The Watchlisting Guidance contains certain exceptions to the minimum substantive derogatory criteria for TORRONST watchlisting that support immigration and visa screening activities by the DHS and DOS to determine whether grounds exist to deny admission of aliens to the United States (including denials of visas) or to deny other immigration benefits pursuant to the INA. ${ }^{39}$ PARTICULARIZED/REFERATORY INFORMATION is not required for nominations made pursuant to the following sections. Because the INA defines "aliens" as "any person not a citizen or national of the United States", the INA admitted by provisions also apply to LPRA, in certain circumstances including those described in INA section 101(a)(11)(C)(R U.S.C. 1101(a)(11)(C)), who are considered as U.S. PERSON under Executive Order 12333. Consequently, NCTC developed a mechanism in 1920 to identify and distinguish U.S. citizens from non-U.S. citizens in order to further distinguish between "aliens" under the INA and U.S. PERSON under Executive Order 12333. The following subsections are exceptions to the HAAR/NARLE SOMICON standard and will only be transmitted to DOS's CLASS (via the DOS CCD) and DHS's WLS to support immigration and visa screening processes.

    ${ }^{39}$ INA section 212(a)(3)(B)(B U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)(B) are both second grounds for readmissibility based on invesive activities, which is defined in INA section 212(a)(3)(B)(A)(B U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)(B)(A)(). For example, INA section 212(a)(3)(B)(A)(VIS) states that any other who "rederves or expenses invesive activity or persuades others to endorse or expense invesive activity or support a invesive organization" is madesuclist to the United States. R U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)(B)(A) VIS. All other uses of the term "ivessive activities" within this Watchlisting Guidance that do not specifically reference the INA follow the definition outlined in Chapter 1 and Appendix 1.

3.14.1 Spouses and Children. Spouses and children ${ }^{37}$ of a KNOWN or SUPPLCTED alien TERMINIST cannot be considered TERMINISTs without a BLANDHARLE SUPNCON that they are engaging or have engaged in conduct constituting, in preparation for, in aid of, or related to TERMINING and/or TERMINIST ACTIVITIES. ${ }^{38}$ The fNA provides that the alien spouse or alien child of an alien who is inadmissible for certain specified reasons relating to terrorist activities, if the activity causing the alien to be found inadmissible occurred within the last five ( 5 ) years, is inadmissible. ${ }^{39}$ An alien spouse or child of an alien who is believed to be inadmissible under the fNA for terrorist activities should be nominated.

3.14.1.2 Ex-spouses, widows, or widowers should not be nominated unless there is a BLANDHARLE SUPNCON to believe that they themselves are engaging or have engaged in conduct constituting, in preparation for, in aid of, or related to TERMINING and/or TERMINIST ACTIVITIES. Deceased spouses should not be nominated unless they are specifically covered in Paragraph 3.17.
3.14.1.3 Once a spouse or child no longer meets the definitional requirements under this section, such an individual should no longer be watchlisted unless there is a BLANDHARLE SUPNCON to believe that the individual is engaging in TERMINING and/or TERMINIST ACTIVITIES. For example, if a child reaches the age of 21 and there is BLANDHARLE SUPNCON to believe he or she was knowingly involved in TERMINIST ACTIVITY by providing material support to a FTO, he or she can remain watchlisted based upon this DERMONTHET INFORMATION. On the other hand, once a child of a KNOWN or SUPPLCTED TERMINIST taxes 21 years of age, the individual should no longer be watchlisted under this exception because he or she is not considered a child of the KNOWN or SUPPLCTED TERMINIST and additional DERMONTHET INFORMATION would be needed to meet the BLANDHARLE SUPNCON standard.

# CHAPTER 4: NO FLY, SELECTEE AND EXPANDED SELECTEE LISTS IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE 

## I. BACKGROUND

4.1 On October 21, 2004, the Depaius Committee established the criteria for the No Fly and Selectee Lists. On January 10, 2005, the DHS released the No Fly and Selectee Lists Implementation Guidance (Implementation Guidance) to provide direction on how to implement the No Fly and Selectee List criteria. The Implementation Guidance was updated and supplemented on July 25, 2006.
4.2 On February 8, 2008, the Depaius Committee approved the addition of a third and fourth criterion to the No Fly List. The Terrorist Removing Center Policy Board Working Group's revised the Implementation Guidance on March 5, 2008, to provide direction on how to implement these new criteria.
4.3 Following the attempted TARGET attack on December 25, 2009, the President directed that a review of the current No Fly and Selectee List criteria be conducted and recommendations he reads regarding whether any adjustments were needed. The Terrorist Removing Center Policy Board Working Group, in conjunction with the Information Sharing Access IPC, recommended certain changes to the lists' criteria and implementation guidance. These recommendations were approved by the Depaius Committee on July 16, 2010.

## II. PRE-CONDITIONS FOR PLACEMENT ON THE NO FLY OR SELECTEE LIST

4.4 Generally, in order to be included on either the No Fly or Selectee List, two pre-conditions must both be met:
4.4.1 Minimum Identifying Criteria. Absent a Special Situation as described below ${ }^{16}$, minimum identifying biographic criteria consisting of First Name, Last Name, Full Date of Birth are required; and,
4.4.2 Minimum Substantive Deregatory Criteria. The minimum substantive derogatory criteria for inclusion must be met. ${ }^{17}$

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{16}$ This Working Group included representatives from Department of State, Department of Justice, Department of
    Consultant Security, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Central Intelligence Agency, Transportation Security
    Administration, National Counterterrorism Center, Terrorist Removing Center, Department of Treasury, and U.S.
    Cupletes and Re for services.
    ${ }^{17}$ See Chapter 4, Section III, for additional information regarding the full date of birth requirement and applicable
    yuceptions.
    ${ }^{18}$ See Paragraph 1.38 for repaidized nominations procedures.
# UNCLASSIFIED/FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION 

## III. NO FLY LIST CRITERIA

4.5 Any person, regardless of citizenship, who represents:
4.5.1 a threat of committing an act of "international TERRONINE" (as defined in 18 U.S.C. 2331(1)) or "domestic TERRONINE" (as defined in 18 U.S.C. 2331(5)) with respect to an aircraft (including a threat of air piracy, or a threat to airline, passenger, or civil aviation security); or,
4.5.2 a threat of committing an act of "domestic TERRONINE" (as defined in 18 U.S.C. 2331(5)) with respect to the homeland ${ }^{26}$; or,
4.5.3 a threat of committing an act of "international TERRONINE" (as defined in 18 U.S.C. 2331(1)) against any U.S. Government facility abroad and associated or supporting personnel, including U.S. entbancies, consulates and missions, military installations (as defined by 10 U.S.C. 2801(c)(4)), U.S. ships, U.S. aircraft, or other auxiliary craft owned or based by the U.S. Government; or,
4.5.4 a threat of engaging in or conducting a violent act of TERRONINE and who is ORGANIZONALLY CORNALE ${ }^{26}$ of doing so.
4.6 Detainees at the Naval Station, Guantaraano Bay, Cuba. Any individual who was a "detainee" held at the Naval Station, Guantaraano Bay, Cuba, unless the President certifies in writing to Congress that the detainee poses no threat to the United States, its citizens, or its allies. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term "detainee" means an individual in the custody or under the physical control of the United States as a result of armed conflict. ${ }^{26}$

## IV. FURTHER CLARIFICATION OF THE NO FLY CRITERIA

4.7 Third No Fly List Criterion. Prior to the addition of the third No Fly List criterion (see Paragraph 4.5.3), a concern over the breadth of the No Fly List arose when SORNIN or SOMNCTED TERRONISTS who posed a threat to a U.S. military base overseas did not meet the criteria for inclusion on the No Fly List. Despite national interests, the threat to the overseas military base did not involve either civil aviation (as set forth in the first No Fly List criterion) or an act of domestic TERRONINE to the homeland (as set forth in the second No Fly List criterion). "Domestic Terrorism" requires that a subject's TERRONIST ACTIVITIES occur primarily within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States. "Homeland" does not include bases and entbancies located abroad. Even in those instances when the IC had identified a KNOWN or SOMNCTED TERRONIST's specific target, KNOWN or SOMNCTED TERRONISTS maintained the advantage of operational flexibility. The third No Fly List criterion addresses

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{26}$ Domestic acts of TERRONIST are those that primarily occur "within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States." See 18 U.S.C. 2331(5)(C)
    ${ }^{27}$ See Paragraph 4.8.2, infra, that defines "ORGANIZONALLY CORNALE."
    ${ }^{28}$ See 44 U.S.C. 44993(2)(2)(C)(4) ${ }^{29}$
    UNCLASSIFIED/FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION
# UNCLASSIFIED/FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION 

this specific vulnerability and counters the ability of KNOWN or SUPPLCTED TERRIBOTS to target U.S. Government facilities outside of the "homeland" (e.g., the October 12, 2000 attack upon the U.S. Navy guided missile destroyer USS Cole while it was harbored in the Yemeni part of Aden).


### 4.8 Fourth No Fly List Criterion

4.8.1 Enable Flexibility. The fourth No Fly List criterion (see Paragraph 4.5.4) is intended to enable flexibility for nominations to the No Fly List of OPERATIENGLY CORNICE KNOWN or SUPPLCTED TERRIBOTS who pose a threat of committing an act of international TERRIBORt abroad, but who do not meet the first, second or third No Fly List criterion because they do not pose a threat to civil aviation, a threat to the homeland, or a threat to U.S. facilities and their associated or supporting personnel. Previously, the No Fly List criteria did not prevent KNOWN or SUPPLCTED TERRIBOTS from traveling abroad aircraft, even though they may have had the intent and OPERATIENGLY CORNILITY to commit a TERRIBOT act against U.S. nationals abroad (outside of the "homeland") or against a target with no rescue to the United States or its nationals. The fourth No Fly List criterion now addresses these two vulnerabilities.
4.8.2 OPERATIENGLY CORNICE Defined. An individual is "OPERATIENGLY CORNILET" if, based on credible intelligence, he or she, acting individually or in concert with others, reasonably appears to have the ability, knowledge, opportunity, and intent or is actively seeking the opportunity to engage in a civilnet act of TERRIBORt consistent with 18 U.S.C. 2551 or 18 U.S.C. 2552b. For example, attempting to obtain an 3D3 would indicate an individual is OPERATIENGLY CORNILET of committing an act of TERRIBORt. However, simple conducting internet research concerning 3D3s would not be sufficient without additional activity. Depending on the circumstances, and in combination with other facts, scouring potential targets or traveling for no facilitator purpose to obtain that have TERRIBOT training grounds, regardless of whether the person is presently capable of using an 1021 , might also indicate an individual is OPERATIENGLY CORNILET committing an act of TERRIBORt.
4.8.3 Possible Indicators of Being OPERATIENGLY CORNICE. In determining whether an individual is OPERATIENGLY CORNILE, consideration should be given to the following indicators regarding ability, knowledge, opportunity, and/or intent:
4.8.3.1 Subject has undergone TERRIBOT training or been provided some instruction, to include receiving military training by a designated terrorist group;
4.8.3.2 Subject has indicated intent to participate in planning/conducting an attack;
4.8.3.3 Subject has expressed desire to martyr him/herself;
4.8.3.4 Subject is in repeated contact with a KNOWN TERRIBOT facilitator who recruits or facilitates travel of operatives;
4.8.3.5 Subject is planning an attack either alone or as part of a group; or,
# UNCLASSIFIED/FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION 

4.8.3.6 Subject is associated with a TERMORIT group/cell and the subject is accumulating weapons/explosives.
4.9 OPERATIONALLY COFURE Semarion. The three scenarios set forth below serve as some examples of No Fly List nominations that would fall under the fourth No Fly List criterion:
4.9.1 There is credible information that the planning or preparation for a TERMORIT attack against the interests of the United States or a foreign government is ongoing and there is no indication that an individual is OPERATIONALLY COFURE;
4.9.2 There is credible information that an individual is linked with an organization known to target U.S. interests. The actual target may be unknown but indicated to be a commercial facility frequented by U.S. citizens abroad. Intelligence identifies an operational or pre-operational capability of this individual whose cell is planning a nearterm attack on a target (e.g., a plot to kill U.S. nationals residing in a foreign head or frequenting a foreign nightclub); or,
4.9.3 There is credible information that an individual is linked with an organization known to target foreign governments. The actual target may be unknown but indicated to be a foreign government facility such as an embassy, consulate, mission or military installation. Intelligence identifies an operational or pre-operational capability of this individual whose cell is planning a near-term attack on a target (e.g., a plot to bomb the British Parliament or the March 11, 2004, Madrid bombing).
4.10 One-Time Waiver Policy.
4.10.1 TSA regulations prohibit U.S. flagged air carriers and foreign flagged air carriers from transporting individuals, who pose the level of threat required for No Fly status, on regulated commercial flights, including all flights operated by U.S. air carriers regardless of the location, and flights operated by foreign air carriers to, from, or over the United States. This prohibition applies regardless of the individual's status as a U.S. PERSON.
4.10.2 When necessary, the U.S. Government may authorize and grant a One Time Waiver (OTW) to an air carrier permitting the carrier to transport an individual on a specified itinerary under controlled conditions. OTWs are coordinated with DHS (including CBP and TSA), FBI, DOS and DGI as appropriate, prior to being authorized by TSC. Once authorized by TSC, TSA will review the conditions of transport and may grant the waiver, permitting the air carrier to transport the individual. If the itinerary changes, or the conditions of transport of the individual change, TSA will deny boarding to the individual until such time as satisfactory conditions are present.
4.10.3 U.S. PERSON Enumerared Overseas.
4.10.3.1 While placement on the No Fly List does not legally bar a U.S. PERSON from

## UNCLASSIFIED/FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION

Page 53
returning to the United States, the U.S. Government has adopted a policy to review all cases in which a U.S. NOKIN on the No Fly List is denied boarding on a commercial flight bound for the United States to determine whether an OTW may be appropriate. TSC will initiate this assessment immediately, and may approve an OTW in advance. TSA will not review or authorize an OTW until such time as an acceptable itinerary is available.
4.10.3.2 In order to facilitate communication with such an individual, the U.S. Government has determined, as a matter of policy, that U.S. Citizens denied boarding on a commercial flight returning to the United States should be referred to the consular section of the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate, which will facilitate communication with the individual, including providing the individual with instructions in the event an OTW is authorized. In keeping with the U.S. Government's traditional policy of neither confirming nor denying whether an individual is on the Terrorist Watchlist, the individual is not informed of his or her watchlist status or that he or she would be traveling under a waiver.

# V. SELECTEE LIST CRITERIA 

4.11 Selectee List Criteria. Any person regardless of citizenship, who does not meet the criteria for inclusion on the No Fly List and who:
4.11.1 is a member of a foreign or domestic TERROR organization ${ }^{70}$ (including a "foreign TERRORIST organization" designated pursuant to Statute or Executive Order, as described in Paragraph 3.11.2); and,
4.11.2 is associated with "TERRORIST ACTIVITY" (as such term is defined in section 212(a)(3)(B) of the INA [B U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)(B)]); unless information exists that demonstrates that the application of secondary screening to such person is not necessary, is which case such persons may be excluded from the Selectee List.

## VI. EXPANDED SELECTEE LIST CRITERIA

4.12 The Expanded Selectee List (ESEL) includes records in the TEDB that contain a full name and full date of birth, regardless of the citizenship of the subject, who do not meet the criteria to be placed on either the No Fly or Selectee Lists, excluding exceptions to the RANONAILLE SUSPON standard.

## VII. ACTIONS BASED UPON POSITIVE MATCHES TO THE NO FLY, SELECTEE, OR EXPANDED SELECTEE LISTS

${ }^{70}$ Members of a defiant terrorist group are included in this criterion if the person was a member of the group when it participated in TERRORIST ACTIVITY.

## UNCLASSIFIED/FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION
# UNCLASSIFIED/FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION 

4.13 The actions resulting from inclusion on the No Fly, Selectee, or Expanded Selectee List are generally as follows:
4.13.1 Individuals that are POSITIVE MAJORES to the No Fly List are prohibited from boarding an aircraft;
4.13.2 Individuals that are POSITIVE MAJORES to the Selectee List undergo enhanced screening prior to boarding an aircraft;
4.13.3 Individuals that are POSITIVE MAJORES to the Expanded Selectee List undergo enhanced screening prior to boarding an aircraft.
4.14 Selectee, Expanded Selectee, and random screening all result in the same operational response of receiving enhanced screening by Transportation Security Officers prior to boarding an aircraft. TSA will notify the TSC of all No Fly, Selectee, and Expanded Selectee POSITIVITIES.

## VIII. IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES

4.15 General Guidelines. The watchfisting community has developed six general guidelines regarding the No Fly and Selectee Lists that should be complemented in order to effectively implement the No Fly List and Selectee List criteria. The six general guidelines are:
4.15.1 When evaluating the significance, relevance and validity of a threat, careful consideration should be given to the extent to which the threat is current, specific and credible;
4.15.2 The Selectee List is not a default position for those who do not qualify for inclusion on the No Fly List and has distinct elements that must be met before an individual may be included;
4.15.3 The purpose of the No Fly List is to protect against acts of ITERMORINE inclusion on the No Fly List has consequences that are operational, legal, economic, and diplomatic.
4.15.4 Except for expedited nominations made pursuant to Paragraph 1.58 of the Watchfisting Guidance, the decision to include a person on the No Fly List or Selectee List must include substantive INEVALUATORY INFORMATION that satisfies the aforementioned criteria and thus justifies inclusion on either list. In cases where nominations contain no substantive INEVALUATORY INFORMATION, or contain insufficient substantive INEVALUATORY INFORMATION, the individual will not be included on either the No Fly List or Selectee List.
4.15.5 In accordance with determinations made pursuant to Paragraph 1.58 of the Watchfisting Guidance, the White House may direct the TSC to place categories of individuals on the No Fly List or the Selectee List on a temporary basis based on current

## UNCLASSIFIED/FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION
# UNCLASSIFIED/FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION 

and credible intelligence information or a particular threat stream that indicates a certain category of individuals may conduct an act of domestic or international tERBORINE.
4.15.6 Under exigent operational circumstances, when INDUCATION INFORMATION may not be widely disseminated or stored in TIDE, individual watchlist status determinations can be made by the Director of the TIC, in accordance with the relevant criteria ${ }^{16}$ contained in the Watchlisting Guidance. Coordination should occur with relevant NOMINATION AGENCIES and SCHEDGES.
4.16 Totality of the Information. The foregoing guidance is neither intended to be determinative nor intended to serve as a checklist. Rather, it is intended to guide the watchlisting community to assessing whether the established criteria are satisfied for a specific record, based on the totality of available information, a current threat stream, and/or the current threat environment.

## IX. SPECIAL SITUATIONS ${ }^{17}$

4.17 Requirement for Full Names and Complete Dates of Birth. Generally, TERBORNY identifies nominated to either the No Fly or the Selection List must have both a full name and a complete date of birth. Identifies without both will usually not be included on either list. Dates of birth shall not be fabricated. ${ }^{18}$
4.17.1 There is, however, a narrow exception to the requirement for full names and complete dates of birth for individuals from non-Visa Waiver Program countries for international TERBORNY nominations. If a non-Visa Waiver Program country ${ }^{19}$ has issued a travel document with only a year of birth, or a verified government-insed identification document with only a year of birth, then it is permissible to use only that year of birth. The NOMINATION AGENCY, however, should, whenever possible, specify the type of document containing the year of birth, and the passport number (if the document is a passport). Otherwise, a year of birth alone will not be accepted for nominations to the No Fly or Selection Lists. The NOMINATION AGENCY has a continuing obligation to attempt to determine the complete date of birth.
4.18 Expedited Waiver of "Full Date of Birth" Requirement for No Fly or Selector Nominations. When necessitated by exigent circumstances, a NOMINATOR may nominate an individual or individuals to the No Fly or Selection List with only a partial date of birth, but for whom there is additional identifying information. This provision is intended to enable nominations based on current and credible intelligence information or a particular threat

The goal of this provision is to fashion a watchlisting response that is appropriate to the nature, specificity, and severity of the threat. To achieve this goal, in addition to the credibility of the threat intelligence, due consideration should be given to:
4.18.1 The harm to public safety posed by the threat;
4.18.2 The clarity and specificity of the information giving rise to the threat as to time, place, method, and identity of the suspected perpetrator(s);
4.18.3 The anticipated impact on international and domestic travel, civil liberties, and foreign relations; and,
4.18.4 The best available screening tools, other than the No Fly or Selectne Lists, given the type and specificity of identifiers and travel data.
4.19 This waiver should be utilized in limited circumstances when extreme SEROIGATORY INFORMATION has been identified demonstrating the threat. The waiver should be valid as long as the threat remains.

## CHAPTER 5: ENCOUNTER MANAGEMENT AND ANALYSIS

## I. INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE

5.1 This guidance addresses the collection, processing, and analysis of TERRIKISM INFORMATION collected by the SCHEDERER during an ENCOUNTER with a watchband subject. As described below, all information gathered during an ENCOUNTER with a KNOWN or SCHPECTER
TERRIKIST ${ }^{88}$ is referred to as an ENCOUNTER PACKAGE. This guidance does not create any new authorities for the collection of any information during ENCOUNTERS with KNOWN or SCHPECTER TERRIKIST. Rather, it identifies the types of information that a Department or Agency should consider collecting during an ENCOUNTER with a KNOWN or SCHPECTER TERRIKIST if it processes the authority to collect such information, and should share with the interagency community consistent with their legal authorities and executive policy. ${ }^{89}$

### 5.2 Definitions

5.2.1 ENCOUNTER. An ENCOUNTER is defined as an event in which an individual is identified during a screening process to be a "POSTUG MAYOU," "POSTUGAL MAYOU," or "PATIPOCLISTEN MAYOU," to an individual who has been designated in the TEDB as a KNOWN or SCHPECTER TERRIKIST. An ENCOUNTER can be a face-to-face meeting with a KNOWN or SCHPECTER TERRIKIST, electronic or a paper-based ENCOUNTER (e.g., the KNOWN or SCHPECTER TERRIKIST has submitted an application for a benefit liked a visa, Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) application, or information is provided to the United States by a foreign government, aircraft operator, or other private entity). Chapter 5 is only concerned with POSTUG MAYOUES, which occur when the TBC determines that information about a subject encountered by a SCHLENLR matches a TEDB record.
5.2.2 TERRIKISM INFORMATION. TERRIKISM INFORMATION in this chapter includes purely domestic terrorism as defined in the TEC MOU and incorporates the definition found in in section 1016 of the IRTPA (6 U.S.C 485), as amended. The term "TERRIKISM INFORMATION" means -
5.2.2.1 all information, whether collected, produced, or distributed by intelligence, law enforcement, military, homeland security, or other activities relating to-
5.2.2.1.1 the existence, organization, capabilities, plans, intentions, vulnerabilities, means of finance or material support, or activities of foreign or international terrorist groups or individuals, or of domestic groups or

Information that could reasonably be expected to assist in the development, proliferation, or use of a weapon of mass destruction (including a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear weapon) that could be used by a TERRORIST or a terrorist organization against the United States, including information about the location of any modqule of nuclear materials that could be exploited for use in such a weapon that could be used by a TERRORIST or a terrorist organization against the United States.

# II. PROCESSING TERRORISM INFORMATION FROM ENCONITERS WITH POSITIVELY IDENTIFIED KNOWN OR SUSPECTED TERRORISTS 

5.3 This section describes the major types of ENCONITERS by various Departments and Agencies. ENCONITR PACKAGES obtained from a KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORIST ENCONITER will be processed as follows:
5.4 Department of Honsfived Security ENCONITRER. (DIS has more ENCONITERS with KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORISTS than any other U.S. Government component. The descriptions below provide information for the majority of DIS ENCONITERS, although it is not an exhaustive list of ENCONITR opportunities or the types of TERRORISE ENCONISTERS available for collection. When lawful and available, both biographic and biometric information will be collected as part of the ENCONITR PACKAGE.
5.4.1 U.S. Customs and Border Protection. CBP ENCONITERS occur at ports of entry (POE), between POEs, or at the last point of departure to the United States at foreign airports through CBP programs like Pre-Chairance and the Immigration Advisory Program (IAP). Information available for collection from these ENCONITERS may include, but is not limited to, pocket litter, travel information, identification documents, travel companions, legal documents, and other information gathered during interviews and the examination process. CBP receives international travel reservation information of KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORISTS for commercial air travel to and from the United States (which may include travel companion information) and international private and

commercial flight manifests, as well as, commercial vessel manifest for travel to and from the United States. With the exception of passenger information required by law to be transmitted to DHS prior to a passenger's arrival, most information is generally collected by CBP when the person is interviewed or apprehended. The National Targeting Center - Passenger (NTC-P) and NTC-Cargo (NTC-C) are CBP entities responsible for communicating with the TSC regarding ENCONTERS with KNOWs or SOMNCTED TEAMMENTS, to include providing relevant ENCONTER information. ${ }^{86}$ NTCP and NTC-C also provide a copy of the examination results to the TSOU for dissemination to the appropriate investigating Agencies.
5.4.2 Transportation Security Administration. TSA generally encounters KNOWN or SOMNCTED TEAMMENTS through screening commercial aircraft passengers against subsets of the TSOR and during the application process for a credential or benefit in the transportation or critical infrastructure environment (e.g., Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC)). When an airline encounters subjects who are possible matches to the No Fly or Seisure Lik, the air carriers are required to supply the passenger's name and one piece of identifying data (in the form of a government-based photo identification that contains a date of birth) to the TSA's Office of Intelligence and Analysis (OIA). TSA OIA submits that information, along with information regarding the carrier, flight number, time of departure, and destination to the TSC.
5.4.2.1 Absent an arrest warrant, or unless probable cause arises during the ENCONTER, SOMNCTED are reminded that placement on the No Fly or Seisure List is not a legal basis to obtain a KNOWN or SOMNCTED TEAMMENT. To the extent legal authority exists to question a KNOWN or SOMNCTED TEAMMENT, encounters with No Fly subjects at the airport may provide an additional opportunity to lawfully obtain ENCONTER FACILAGE information. For No Fly subjects who have made a domestic reservation, DHS will notify TSC in advance as well as when the No Fly subject presents at the airport ticket counter. TSC will then notify the TSOU who will notify both the VIS case agent and the airport liaison agent to coordinate the appropriate operational response.
5.4.2.2 For KNOWN or SOMNCTED TEAMMENT ENCONTERS as a result of an individual applying for a TSA benefit or credential, ENCONTER FACILAGE information can include any supporting documents or information collected as a part of the application process. The ENCONTER, and any corresponding information, is communicated to the TSC and other Government Agencies, as appropriate through TSA OIA.
5.4.3 United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCS) interact with millions of individuals every year and

ENCOUNTERS KNOWN or SUPPLCTED TERMINISTS who file petitions or applications for immigration benefits internationally and domestically. ${ }^{35}$ The USCIS official contacts the TSC to report an ENCOUNTER with a KNOWN or SUPPLCTED TERMINIST. Before making a decision on the immigration application or benefit, USCIS contacts the ORIGINATION/NOMINATOR to obtain additional information that may help determine whether the individual is eligible or ineligible to receive the immigration benefit. In such cases, USCIS aneks further information from the record owner or case agent and may seek de-classification of information relating to the application. In addition, USCIS contacts the ORIGINATION/ROMINATOR to discuss whether the USCIS decision to grant or deny the application or benefit would interrupt or negatively affect any ongoing investigation.
5.4.3.1 USCIS maintains a presence at law enforcement and intelligence Agency entities to further information sharing regarding KNOWN or SUPPLCTED TERMINIST. USCIS maintains information, including the subject's Allen File (AFile) and other records. The type of information that may be contained in USCIS files, including the A-File, could be biometric data (cheapprints and photographs); identity documents; information relating to the application; addresses, as well as family and work history information; immigration benefit application information; and records of previous ENCOUNTERS that DHS has had with the subject. Other SCHEDNESS - as well as other appropriate organizations who are considering nominating a potential KNOWN or SUPPLCTED TERMINIST or who have ENCOUNTERS with a person who is a POSITIVE MATCH to a KNOWN or SUPPLCTED TERMINIST- are advised that they can request, on a case-by-case basis, a copy of the KNOWN or SUPPLCTED TERMINIST'S A-File from USCIS if the KNOWN or SUPPLCTED TERMINIST has applied for immigration or citizenship benefits. ${ }^{36}$
5.4.4 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is the principal investigative arm of DHS. ICE is also the federal law enforcement organization responsible for immigration and customs-related investigations and detention within the interior and at the borders of the United States. ICE frequently ENCOUNTERS potential KNOWN or SUPPLCTED TERMINISTS during enforcement activities under its purview. Such ENCOUNTERS are documented within ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) via the Known Suspected Terrorist Encounter Protocol and reported to the TSC and ICE's Homeland Security Investigations (SHS). ICE SHS Special Agents frequently encounter KNOWN or SUPPLCTED TERMINISTS internationally, domestically, at U.S. POEa, and when KNOWN or SUPPLCTED TERMINISTs are the subjects of an ICE Investigation. These ENCOUNTERS are

documented by 100 Special Agents in Reports of Investigation (ROI). All ROIs
documenting UNEVENTERS/interviews with a KNOWN or SUPPLIED TERRORIST are shared with the IC.
5.4.4.1 In addition, under section 428 of the Homeland Security Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security has the authority to refuse visas in accordance with the law and to assign employees of DHS to diplomats and consular posts to review vis appliations and conduct investigations. ${ }^{20}$ ICE, through the Visa Security Program, exercises this authority. Reviews of visa applications and interviews with applicants can result in the encounter of KNOWN or SUPPLIED TERRORIST, facilitators, and associates as well as reveal previously unknown information relating to KNOWN or SUPPLIED TERRORIST. HSI personnel assigned to the Visa Security Program, and to U.S. Embasins and Consulates abroad, work closely with their DER counterparts to identify KNOWN or SUPPLIED TERRORISTs and report findings through established processes. Finally, ICE may encounter KNOWN or SUPPLIED TERRORISTs awaiting immigration bearings who are housed in service processing/detection centers. These detection facilities can document interactions with the aliens while they are detained in the facility, as well as document materials found on the individual at the time of processing. For all immigration and enforcement activities, ICE will communicate with the TSC regarding encounters with watchlisted individuals, and will submit relevant UNEVENTER information to the TSC.
5.4.5 United States Coast Guard. The U.S. Coast Guard's Coastwatch branch screens crew and passenger information on vessel manifests, which are required by regulation to be transmitted to the National Visual Movement Center (NYMC) prior to a vessel's arrival in a U.S. port. Coastwatch communicates with the NTC-P and TSC regarding any KNOWN or SUPPLIED TERRORIST UNEVENTERS during this process. The Coast Guard physically encounters few KNOWN or SUPPLIED TERRORISTs, and each UNEVENTERS could occur from random and regular inspections of vessels and port facilities, ship boardings, investigations, or Coast Guard licensing activities. The type of information available for collection is dependent on the type of UNEVENTER. The UNEVENTER, and any corresponding information, is communicated to the TSC through Coast Guard Office of Intelligence and Criminal Investigations. Based on the encountering situation, intelligence reporting will be written to provide situational awareness to the IC.
5.4.6 United States Secret Service. Although United States Secret Service (USSS) does not encounter many KNOWN or SUPPLIED TERRORISTs, such UNEVENTERS usually involve KNOWN or SUPPLIED TERRORISTs with a domestic status in PERIODING. Such encounters can be the result of investigations or for event screening (e.g., National Security Special Events, political events, large scale sporting events). These

ENCIUNTERS will be coordinated with the FBI, who will handle them as they do all other FBI KNOWN or SUPPLCTED TERMINIST ENCONTERS.
5.4.7 Department of Honsined Security Intelligence \& Analysis. DOIS I\&A provides cod products and analytical reports, which are generally available to the NCTC and the broader counterterrorism analytic community, including fusion centers. DOIS I\&A works closely with DOIS components to ensure non-traditional armans of information are found with traditional sources of information from other members of the IC to give a complete picture of potential threats to the nation. DOIS I\&A "connects the data" for intelligence reporting and ENCONTERS of the DOIS components, and as such, has limited opportunity for ENCONTERS with KNOWN or SUPPLCTED TERMINISTs.
5.5 Department of State Encounters. For DOIS INCILINTERS with a person who is a POSITIVE MATCH to a KNOWN or SUPPLCTED TERMINIST, the DOIS unit at the TSC will do the following:
5.5.1 Visa Applications. DOS/TSC will upload the electronic visa application from the CCD to the individual's EMA record. DOS/ TSC will coordinate with the overseas posts to scan in CCD all other available DOS documents associated with the individual. DOIS information about whether a visa is issued is currently available in individual case records in the CCD; DOIS is currently investigating upgrades to the CCD's report function that will make the visa decision data more easily accessible to TSC and other users.
5.5.2 Visa Reveasions. DOS/ TSC will upload the electronic visa application from the CCD to the individual's EMA record.
5.5.3 Passports. After encounters with KNOWN or SUPPLCTED TERMINISTs processing passports issued by the United States, the TNOC will upload the Passport Information Electronic Records System (PIERS) application forms from the CCD to the individual's EMA record. DOS/ TSC will coordinate with the overseas posts to scan in CCD all other available DOS documents associated with the individual.
5.6 United States Agency for International Development ENCONTERS. United States Agency for International Development (USAID) works in agriculture, democracy and governance, economic growth, the environment, education, health, global partnerships, and humanitarian assistance in more than 100 countries. When USAID services an application seeking financial assistance, prior to granting, these applications are subject to setting by USAID intelligence analysis at the TSC. If USAID/TSC finds that an application relates to a person who is a POSITIVE MATCH to a KNOWN or SUPPLCTED TERMINIST in the TRIBE, USAID/TSC will provide any TERMINISTECHINEMATICN concerning the application and follow standard TSC procedures for processing TERMINISTECHINEMATICN, to include logging the ENCONTER in EMA.
5.7 Foreign Partner Encounters. After each ENCONTER by a foreign partner, DOS/ TSC will ask the respective country for the subject's photo, additional biographic data and any

## UNCLASSIFIED/FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION
# UNCLASSIFIED/FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION 

TORRORISM INFORMATION on the DICIUNITER Information List gathered during the DICIUNITER. Provision of any material collected by the foreign partner depends on the arrangement with, and legal authorities of, the particular foreign partner involved. Therefore, gathering and sharing this TORRORISM INFORMATION will be done on a case-by-case, countryby-country basis.
5.8 Federal Bureau of Investigation/Law Enforcement ENCONSTRY. These DICIUNITER can be subdivided into three categories:
5.8.1 Name-Based Queries. Name-based transaction queries by law enforcement personnel (e.g., traffic stops) made to the FBI's National Crime Information Center at the Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Division that match a name in the KSTF (a sub-file of NCIC) are deemed to be MOUNISEL MAILOES. They are rooted electronically to TSC for confirmation and subsequent processing as an DOCIUNITER.
5.8.2 Fingerprint-Based Queries. Fingerprint-based queries submitted for criminal identification purposes (e.g., an arrest/booking) or for civil identification purposes (e.g., an employment background check) are made to the Integrated Automatic Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS). For PULIOE MAILOES to records flagged as KNOWs or SOMOTED TORRORST records, the CJIS Division's Special Identities Unit notifies the TSC and the FBI case agent (or the Agency that identified the subject as a possible TORRORST). In similar fashion, CJIS Division's Global Isolatives Unit coordinates positive fingerprint hits from its foreign submissions with the Legal Attaché. It should be noted that IAFIS and NCIC are separate systems that are not fully synchronized at the present time.
5.8.3 National Instant Criminal Background Check System. All background checks resulting from attempts to buy firearms or to obtain explosive permits submitted to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) at CJIS are run against the KSTF. The TSC is immediately notified of all KSTF "bits." NICS consults with TSC to confirm the PULIOE MAILOES and the FBI case agent to determine whether there is available information about the prospective purchase to disqualify lists or bar from processing a firearm or explosive as a matter of law. Regardless of whether the purchase is denied or permitted to proceed, all available information is obtained and provided to the TSC and, in turn, CTD, an TORRORISM INFORMATION and processed as an DOCIUNITER.
5.9 Department of Defense ENCONSERs. The Department of Defense (DoD) has force protection, operational capture/approland, and intelligence responsibilities and on occasion encounters ANIMAL or SOMOTED TORRORSTs. To the extent DoD knowingly encounters a KNOWs or SOMOTED TORRORST, DoD will report the DOCIUNITER in intelligence channels or to the FBI in cases described in the NICE between the FBI and DoD Governing Information Sharing, Operational Coordination and Investigative Responsibilities signed August 2, 2011 where the FBI is the lead. In cases where the FBI is not the lead for the DOCIUNITER, the

5.13.1 For domestic and international DOCULIVITIES with a person who is a POSITIVE MATCH to a KNOWN or SUPPLIED TERRORIST, TREK) will do the following: After receiving notification of an DOCULIVITIE from the TSC, TREK will disseminate and coordinate information to FBI operational entities and federal, state, and local law enforcement Agencies. TREK) simultaneously coordinates with the appropriate FBI Field Division(s) and Case Agent(s); Joint Terrorist Task Forcea (JTTFs); Airport Liaison Agents and Attaches (ALAs); 2.agal Attachés (LEGATs); U.S. Embassies and/or other appropriate law enforcement officials, including ICE and CBP (specifically, NTC-P and NTC-C as appropriate); and appropriate members of the IC. For outboard DOCULIVITIES, or DOCULIVITIES involving subjects who have certain JEMPLOYTARY INFORMATION, TREK) contacts (via phone and electronic notification) the appropriate counterterrorism element(s). Especially sensitive DOCULIVITIES often require coordination and situational updates with the White House, Northern Command (NORTIICOM), and FBI's Counterterrorism Watch.
5.14 TSC Asthma. TSC will update existing KNOWN or SUPPLIED TERRORIST records with new TERRORIST EMPATHERS and TERRORISM INFORMATION and will provide the broader counterterrorism analytic community with as much new information as possible stemming from an DOCULIVITIE with a KNOWN or SUPPLIED TERRORIST. TSC's primary methods for sharing TERRORISM INFORMATION with the broader counterterrorism analytic community will be through its EMA application and the use of Intelligence Information Reports (IIRs), as described further in Section V, infra. TSC will also coordinate with Fusion Centers or law enforcement and other DOCULIVITIES impacting their Area of Responsibility. This coordination will include a request for record enhancing information from the Fusion Center, which if received, will be added to the subject's KNOWN or SUPPLIED TERRORIST record.
5.14.1 Any new TERRORISM INFORMATION recorded in, or attached to an EMA record by TSC will be provided to NCTC via an automated legrot process ${ }^{86}$ Such daily ingents of EMA records update NCTC's TIDE is reffect the fact of the DOCULIVITIE, any new identifiers used to confirm the KNOWN or SUPPLIED TERRORIST POSITIVE MATCHS, or those identified in an IIR. Once TIDE has been updated, an automated ingest from TIDE to TREK is used to update the various TREK subsets (e.g., No Fly or Sehance Lins). At this point, the process is complete and the watchfaring, screening and law

This process allows NCTC to open KNOWN or SUPPLIED TERRORIST records that have been awarded or updated. This process also accumulates the benefits of medical information such as its received from treatments. As these instances, the DOCULIVITIE FACILIZED eppote its attachments to the KNOWN or SUPPLIED TERRORIST record. DOCULIVITIE FACILIZd attachments must be served to another system in order to give the broader counterterrorism community access to the TERRORISM INFORMATION. That process is described in Section V, infra.
# UNCLASSIFIED/FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION 

enforcement communities have the most current and thorough TERRORUM INFORMATION available about a KNOWN or SUPPLCTO TERRORIST. Meal - but not all - of that TERRORUM INFORMATION is available in a structured format as part of the KNOWN or SUPPLCTO TERRORIST record (e.g., discrete elements such as a date of birth, country of origin). The unstructured TERRORUM INFORMATION, while also in digitized format (e.g. a computer disk, a scanned image of a business card, an encountering office's report), is handled by NCTC.
5.15 NCTC Actions. NCTC will post to TIDE Online any digitized EXCOUNTER PACKAGE it receives from TBC or directly from a SCHEDAER. EXCOUNTER PACKAGES can be found under the subject's main page.
V. ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES FOR UPDATING EXISTING KNOWN OR SUSPECTED TERRORIST RECORDS AND NOMINATING NEW KNOWN OR SUSPECTED TERRORISTS BASED ON INFORMATION FROM POSITIVE ENCOUNTERS
5.16 This section describes the roles and responsibilities of the watchfaring, screening, and countertearvium communities for exploitation and analysis of the TERRORUM INFORMATION lawfully collected and shared when there is a POSITIVE INVEST to a KNOWN or SUPPLCTO TERRORIST. In this context the following definitions apply:
5.16.1 "PMTIAL REVIEW" means a quick review of the ENCOUNTER PACKAGE to identify obvious, new TERRORIST GISTRIERS about the KNOWN or SUPPLCTO TERRORIST.
5.16.2 "ABVANCED BAAL FIRR" means a thorough review of the TERRORUM INFORMATION contained in an EXCOUNTER PACKAGE obtained as a result of the EXCOUNTER with the KNOWN or SUPPLCTO TERRORIST. ADVANCED ANALYSIS includes the adding of TERRORIST GISTRIERS to existing KNOWN or SUPPLCTO TERRORIST records and identifying new KNOWN or SUPPLCTO TERRORISTS who should be nominated through the existing nomination process. In this context, ADVANCED ANALYSIS is being done on a tactical matter related to the specific KNOWN or SUPPLCTO TERRORIST to identify information useful in "connecting the data" between and among that KNOWN or SUPPLCTO TERRORIST and other KNOWN or SUPPLCTO TERRORISTS or potential KNOWN or SUPPLCTO TERRORISTS. It is also when the need for foreign language translation services will be identified.
5.16.3 "FAMILYED ANALYSIS" means further exploitation of a targeted set of EXCOUNTER PACKAGES and ADVANCED ANALYSIS products to assist in identifying TERRORIST trends and changes to methods, tactics, and practices. EXCOUNTERS for FARILYED ANALYSIS are selected using contemporaneous threat criteria and research in additional repositories. Contemporaneous threat criteria includes association with a priority terrorist group (e.g., NIPY Tier I or II); EXCOUNTERS with KNOWN or SUPPLCTO

## UNCLASSIFIED/FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION
![img-11.jpeg](img-11.jpeg)
5.17.3 FBI Actions. The majority of the FBI's ENCOUNTERS with KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERMINISTs occur in the United States. The FBI has ADVANCED ANALYSIS responsibility for ENCOUNTER PACKAGES ON KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERMINISTs for whom the FBI has no open investigation, no matter where the individual is encountered. If the FBI does not have an open investigation on a KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERMINIST encountered in the United States, or if the KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERMINIST is a U.S. PERSON, then TIESE will send a lead directing the appropriate FBI field office to conduct an assessment of the individual and the ENCOUNTER circumstances to determine whether to open a preliminary or full investigation. ${ }^{86}$ This assessment includes ADVANCED ANALYSIS packages when provided by ENCOUNTERING AGENCIES. If no investigation is opened, an IIR will be sent to the NOMINATIONALAGENCY and NCTC which will be used to enhance the TIDE record with additional FBI-derived information.
5.17.4 DHS I\&A Actions. DHS I\&A has ADVANCED ANALYSIS responsibility for ENCOUNTER PACKAGES where the KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERMINIST is denied entry, denied ESTA, denied boarding, or is subject to a no board recommendation at a foreign location, or identified through ICE's visa security processes.
5.17.5 NCTC Actions. On occasion, DOS, USAID, and foreign governments have ENCOUNTERS with KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERMINISTs, usually in the form of a record ENCOUNTER (e.g., the KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERMINIST has submitted an application for a benefit like a visa or grant or information is provided to the United States by a foreign government). NCTC has ADVANCED ANALYSIS responsibility for ENCOUNTER PACKAGES in these instances.
5.17.5.1 For UNRECIDA ANALYSIS, NCTC offers this capability for a select set of ENCOUNTER PACKAGES based on internal or interagency tasking. Since all ADVANCED ANALYSIS products created by FBI, DOS, or NCTC will be disseminated to the U.S. Government via an IIR, these materials are available to any organization seeking to further exploit specific ENCOUNTERS. NCTC will leverage these ADVANCED ANALYSIS products as part of its typical intelligence analytic process to highlight emerging threats, issues or concerns.
5.17.6 A chart depicting the roles and responsibilities by Department or Agency may be found at the end of this Chapter.

# VI. RESPONSIBILITY TO COORDINATE ANY ACTIONS 

CONTEMPLATED BASED ON INFORMATION FROM ENCOUNTERS WITH A KNOWN OR SUSPECTED TERMINIST

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{86}$ Under governing authorities, the FBI can conduct "instruments" for an authorized purpose, such as obtaining information about a threat to national security, without a particular factual production. To open an investigation whether a "preliminary" or "full" investigation - there must be a specific factual production.
5.18 Information Sharing MOU Requirements. Departments and Agencies are reminded of their agreement to provide transparency between and among them with regard to their "televisory to prompt, prevent, and disrupt TERRIBIST attacks against U.S. PERSON and interests. ${ }^{20,21}$ As a practical matter, that type of transparency demands, to the greatest extent possible, prior coordination with affected Departments or Agencies before action within a Department or Agency's authorities is taken based on TERRIBISM INFORMATION from a person who is a POSITIVE NUCLO in a KNOWN or SUPPLCTED TERRIBIST. For example, FBI, Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) or DOEI, as lead counterterrorism Agencies in their respective domains, must be consulted prior to taking any action based on UNCENTERS with a person who is a POSITIVE NUCLO with KNOWN or SUPPLCTED TERRIBIST. This guidance is subject to existing policies and coordination procedures when action against or pertaining to the KNOWN or SUPPLCTED TERRIBIST is contemplated.
5.19 Requests for Withholding of Action. In certain circumstances, law enforcement or the IC may request that a NERGNER not take action (e.g., not to refuse the visa, to allow individual to enter the United States, to not deny an individual to obtain an immigration benefit or access to the secure area of an airport) although action may be taken under the law. This request, to the extent practicable, shall be in writing, by a senior official, and include a statement of justification and risk obligation. Departments and Agencies will establish mutually acceptable processes and procedures to implement a detailed plan.

# VII. EXAMPLES OF TERRORISM INFORMATION TYPICALLY AVAILABLE FROM ENCOUNTERS 

5.20 The following examples of various types of DOCUENTERS and the type of information typically generated from those ENCOUNTERS is offered to assist Departments and Agencies in understanding what additional or new information may become available as a result of following the guidance provided in this document.
5.20.1 Ports of Entry. Types of documents that could be included in the DOCUENTER PACKAGE typically include:

1. Business cards
2. Copies of passport and visa entries
[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{20}$ See Paragraph 30(a) of the Information Sharing MOU (Appendix D): "Precipently and Transparency. All information collected by any study, relevant to the efficiency and responsibilities of any other current entities should be shared, in the present sense possible, between and among all current entities. Likewise, the parties agree that, to the greatest extent possible, there should be transparency between and among the current entities with regard to their activities to prompt, prevent, and disrupt TERRIBIST attacks against U.S. PERSON and interests. Except an otherwise specified in this Agreement, or standard by relevant Federal entities or Presidential Donations, procedures and mechanisms for intervention sharing, use, and handling shall be interposed and implemented continuously and successfully, regardless of the role a particular external entity place on a provider or recipient of current information. In other words, the example, international TERRIBISM INFORMATION collected by the literate Federal should be shared by DOEI with the IC in the same extent foreign intelligence information on TERRIBISM is shared by the IC with DOEI."

# UNCLASSIFIED/POR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION 

A. ADVANCED ANALYSIS: is a thorough review of the TERROBISM INFORMATION contained in an ENCONSTRY PATAAGE obtained as a result of the ENCONSTRY with the KNOWN or SUPPLITIO TERRODIT. ADVANCED ANALYSIS includes the adding of TERROBIST IDENTIFIERS to existing KNOWN or SUPPLITIO TERROBIST records and identifying new KNOWN or SUPPLITIO TERROBISTs who should be nominated through the existing nomination process. In this context, ADVANCED ANALYSIS is being done on a tactical matter related to the specific KNOWN or SUPPLITIO TERROBIST to identify information useful in "connecting the data" between and among that KNOWN or SUPPLITIO TERROBIST and other KNOWN or SUPPLITIO TERROBISTs or potential KNOWN or SUPPLITIO TERROBISTs. It is also when the need for foreign language translation services will be identified.
B. ALGORILATION: are those who receive and hold TERROBISM INFORMATION and certain other non-TERROBISM INFORMATION they are authorized to receive and retain.
C. HEROGATORY INFORMATION: is intelligence or information that demonstrates the nature of an individual's or group's association with TERROBISM AND/or TERROBIST ACTIVITIES.
D. ENCOUNTER: is an event in which an individual is identified during a screening process to be a "POSTTUENNCELL'" "POSTTUNAL MATCH," or "PICONCLUSTIC MATCH," to an individual who has been designated in the TSEN as a KNOWN or SUPPLITIO TERROBIST. An ENCOUNTER can be a face-to-face meeting with a KNOWN or SUPPLITIO TERROBIST, electronic or a paper-based ENCOUNTER (e.g., the KNOWN or SUPPLITIO TERROBIST has submitted an application for a benefit liked a visa, ETSA grant, or information is provided to the United States by a foreign government, aircraft operator, or other private entity).
E. ENCOUNTERING AGENCY: is a Department or Agency of the U.S. Government with TERROBIST screening or law enforcement responsibilities that comes into contact with a KNOWN or SUPPLITIO TERROBIST (whether in a face-to-face situation or via an electronic or written submission such as an application for a benefit) that the TSC determines is a POSTTUNATER to a KNOWN or SUPPLITIO TERROBIST.
F. ENCOUNTER PATAAGE: is all information gathered during an ENCOUNTER with a KNOWN or SUPPLITIO TERROBIST.
G. ENHANCEMENT: is the addition of new TERROBIST IDENTIFIERS or ORIGGATORY INFORMATION on a KNOWN or SUPPLITIO TERROBIST.
H. FORMON FEDERING: are nationals of one country who travel or attempt to travel to another country to participate in TERROBISM AND/Or TERROBIST ACTIVITIES.
I. FRAGMENTARY INFORMATION: is information that suggests an individual may have a reason to TERROBISM AND/Or TERROBIST ACTIVITIES but the information available to the SEMBRATOR does not meet either or both the minimum identifying criteria that will facilitate identification of those individuals or the substantive ORIGGATORY INFORMATION to meet the REGIONABLE SUPPLION standard but does qualify as information that should be provided to NCTC pursuant to HSPD-6.

UNCLASSIFIED/FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION
J. NEUNCLERYMATCH: Is the final determination by TSC that limited information in the subject data set matches TSDB data in a TSDB record and no additional identifiers are available to verify the match.
K. INITIAL REVIEW: Is a quick primary review of the INCOUNTER FACILAGE to identify obvious, new TEORNEST IDENTIFIERS about the ENOWN or SOPECTED TEORNEST.
L. KNOWN TEORNEST: is an individual whom the U.S. Government knows is engaged, has been engaged, or who intends to engage in TEORNEST and/or TEORNEST ACTIVITY, including an individual ( $x$ ) who has been, charged, arrested, indicted, or convicted for a crime related to TEORNEST by U.S. Government or foreign government authorities; or (b) identified as a terrorist or member of a designated foreign terrorist organization pursuant to statute, Executive Order or international legal obligation pursuant to a United Nations Security Council Resolution.
M. LOW WOLF: an individual motivated by one or more extremists ideologies, who operates alone and supports, or engages in acts of violence in furtherance of that ideology or ideologies that may involve direction, assistance, or influence from a larger terrorist organization of a foreign actor.
N. NOMINATOR or NOMINATING DEPARTMENT OR AGENCY: Is a Federal Department or Agency that has information to indicate that an individual meets the criteria for a ENOWN or SOPECTED TEORNEST and nominates that individual to TEDE and the TSDB based on information that originated with that Department or Agency and/or a third Department or Agency.
O. OPERATIONALLY CAPABLE: as described in Chapter 4, an individual is "OPERATENALLY CANALYSIS", based on credible intelligence, he or she, acting individually or in concert with others, reasonably appears to have the ability, knowledge, opportunity, and intent or is actively seeking the opportunity to engage in a project act of TEORNEST consistent with 18 U.S.C. 2331 or 18 U.S.C. 2332 b . For example, attempting to obtain an STD would indicate an individual is OPERATENALLY CANALYSIS of committing an act of TEORNEST. However, simply conducting interest research concerning SEDs would not be sufficient without additional activity. Depending on circumstances, and in combination with other facts, scouring potential targets or traveling for no legitimate purpose to places that have TEORNEST training grounds, regardless of whether the person is presently capable of using an STD, might also indicate an individual is OPERATENALLY CAPABLE of committing an act of TEORNEST.
F. ONGINGTON: Is the Department or Agency that has appropriate subject matter interest and classification authority and collects TEORNEST/OPERATEN (i.e., new information) and disseminates it or TEORNEST IDENTIFIERS to other U.S. Government entities in an intelligence report (i.e., finished intelligence) or other mechanism.
O. PARTICULARIZED DERIVOLVEDY INFORMATION: Is the type of information relied on to determine whether ECOGENELE SOPECTON is met. This is information that demonstrates the nature of an individual's or group's association with TEORNEST and/or TEORNEST ACTIVITIES

UNCLASSIFIED/FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION
UNCLASSIFICIO/FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION
that is descriptive and specific to an event or activity, and is more than a label. For example, "Subject X provides false travel documentation for 44 Qpida operations" is PAPECLASSIFIO INDUDAIORT INFORMATION, whereas "Subject Y is a supporter," standing alone, is not considered PAPECLLABSIZED INDUDAIORT INFORMATION.
B. POSTIVE MATCH: occurs when the TSC determines that information about a subject encountered by a SCIKIDNE exactly or reasonably matches a record in the TSDB.
S. POTENTIAL MATCH: occurs when an OXCRAINTENGL ASSOCY believes it has a match with a KNOWt or SUPPLCTIO TERRIBUT record in the TSDB. An OXCRAINTENGL ASSOCY may attempt to resolve POTENTIAL MATCHES first through its review process. If an OXCROINTENGL ASSOCY's review process cannot resolve the individual's status as not a match to a TSDB record, the OXCROINTENGL ASSOCY will refer the POTENTIAL MATCH to TSC for final adjudication.
T. FORELY HOMETIC TERRIBUM INFORMATION: is defined in the ZSC MOU as information about U.S. PERSONS that has been determined to be FORELY HOMETIC TERRIBUM INFORMATION with "no link to foreign intelligence, counterintelligence, or international TERRIBUM."
U. REALOMABLE SUPPLION: is the standard that must be met in order to include an individual in the TSDB, absent an exception provided for in the Watchlizing Guidance. To meet the KAARPAHILE SUPPLION standard, the NOMBACOR, based on the totality of the circumstances, must rely upon articulable intelligence or information which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrants a determination that an individual is known or suspected to be or has been knowingly engaged in conduct constituting, in preparation for, in aid of, or related to TERRIBUM and/or TERRIBUT ACTIVITIES. There must be an objective factual basis for the NOMBACOR in believe that the individual is a KNOWt or SUPPLCTIO TERRIBUT. More garents or hunches are not enough to constitute a KAARPAHILE SUPPLION that an individual is a KNOWt or SUPPLCTIO TERRIBUT. Reporting of suspicious activity alone that does not meet the KAARPAHILE SUPPLION standard set forth herein is not a sufficient basis to watchlist an individual. The facts, however, given fair consideration, should possibly lead to the conclusion that an individual is, or has, engaged in TERRIBUM and/or TERRIBUT ACTIVITIES.
V. SURGEOND: a Department or Agency that is authorized to conduct TERRIBUM screening to determine if an individual is a possible match to a KNOWt or SUPPLCTIO TERRIBUT in the TSDB. SCIKINERS can include Federal Departments or Agencies, state, local, tribal, territorial, or foreign governments and certain private entities. The term "SCKINER" is used throughout this document as a general reference to a government official who compares an individual's information with information in the TSDB to determine if an individual is in the TSDB. Less enforcement officials who engage in such activities may normally describe their targeting or other actions in this context as other than "screaming." For ease of reference, government officials who compare an individual's information with information in the TSDB will be referred to in the Watchlizing Guidance as a "SCKINER."
W. SUPPLCTIO TERRIBUT: is an individual who is KAARPAHILE SUPPLCTIO to be, or has been engaged in conduct constituting, in preparation for, in aid of, or related to TERRIBUM and/or TERRIBUT ACTIVITIES based on an articulable and KAARPAHILE SUPPLION.

5. TAKEIYER ANALYSIS: is further exploitation of a ragged set of ENCHINEER PACKAGES and ADVANCED ANALYSIS products to assist in identifying TERMINIST trends and changes to methods, tactics, and practices. ENCHINTERS for TARGETED ANALYSIS are selected using contemporaneous threat criteria, and research in additional repositories. Contemporaneous threat criteria include association with a priority terrorist group (e.g., NIPF Tier I or II); ENCHINTERS with KNOWS or SUPPACTED TERMINISTs designated as No Fly or associated with violent activity; or at the request of any Department or Agency that identifies a need.
V. TERMINUM AND/OR TERMINIST ACTIVITIES: is a combination of definitions because none of the federal law definitions of "terrorism" or "terrorist activities" were directly applicable to the consolidated approach to watchtaking. For terrorist watchtaking purposes under this Watchtaking Guidance, "terrorism and/or terrorist activities" combine elements from various federal definitions and are considered to: (a) involve violent acts or acts dangerous to human life, property, or infrastructure that may be a violation of U.S. law, or may have been, if those acts were committed in the United States; and, (b) appear intended to intimidate or contra a civilian population, influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion, or affect the conduct of government by mass destruction, assassination, kidnapping, or hostage-taking. This includes activities that facilitate or support TERMINUM and/or TERMINIST ACTIVITY, such as providing a safe house, transportation, communications, funds, transfer of funds or other material benefit, false documentation or identification, weapons (including chemical, biological, or radiological weapons), explosives, or training for the commission of act of terrorism and/or TERMINIST ACTIVITY.
Z. TERMINIM INFORMATION: applies, where appropriate, to purely domestic terrorism as defined in the TSC MOST and incorporates the definition found in in section 1016 of the IETPA (6 U.S.C. 485), as amended. The term "TERMINIM INFORMATION" means -

1. all information, whether collected, produced, or distributed by intelligence, law enforcement, military, homeland security, or other activities relating to -
a) the existence, organization, capabilities, plans, intentions, vulnerabilities, means of finance or material support, or activities of foreign or international terrorist groups or individuals, or of domestic groups or individuals involved in international TERMINIM;
b) threats posed by such groups or individuals to the United States, U.S. FURSONE, or United States interests, or to those of other nations;
c) communications of or by such groups or individuals; or
d) groups or individuals reasonably believed to be assisting or associated with such groups or individuals; and
2. includes weapons of mass destruction information.
a) Weapons of Mass Destruction Information: information that could reasonably be expected to assist in the development, proliferation, or use of a weapon of mass destruction (including a chemical, biological,
# UNCLASSIFIED/FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY/SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION 

radiological, or nuclear weapon) that could be used by a TERRORIST or a terrorist organization against the United States, including information about the location of any stockpile of nuclear materials that could be exploited for use in such a weapon that could be used by a TERRORIST or a terrorist organization against the United States.
AA. TERRORISN SCREENING INFORMATION is defined in the standard HSPO-6 agreement to mean unclassified identifying information about KNOWN or SUSPECTED TERRORISTs.
BB. TERRORIST: please see KNOWN TERRORIST or SUSPECTED TERRORIST.
CC. TERRORIST (SENTERIER) are referred to in the TEC MOU as U/FF/D/O data for inclusion into the TSDR. TERRORIST (SENTERIER) are data points about a particular identity that include names and aliases, dates of birth, places of birth, unique identifying numbers, passport information, country of origin and nationality, physical identifiers, addresses, photographs or renderings of the individual, fingerprints or other biometric data, employment data, license plate numbers, and any other TERRORIST/INFORMATION that ORIGINATIONS specifically provide for passage to the TSC.
DB. TERRORIST INFORMATION as defined in HSPO-6 is "information about individuals known or appropriately suspected to be or have been engaged in conduct constituting, in preparation for, in aid of, or related to TERRORISN."
EE. U.S. PERSON is defined in Executive Order 12333 (as amended) as "a United States citizen, as alien known by the intelligence element concerned to be a permanent resident alien, an unincorporated association substantially composed of United States citizens or permanent resident aliens, or a corporation incorporated in the United States, except for a corporation directed and controlled by a foreign government or governments." The Watchlining Guidance contains certain exceptions to the minimum substantive derogatory standards for TERRORIST watchlining that support immigration and visa screening activities by the DHS and DHS to determine whether instigabilities exist for admission to the United States or visa adjudication pursuant to the INA. Because the INA defines "alien" as any person not a citizen or national of the United States, the INA admissibility provisions also apply to LPRs, in certain circumstances, who are considered as U.S. PERSON under Executive Order 12333. Consequently, NCTC developed a mechanism in 7/DB to identify and distinguish U.S. citizens from non-U.S. citizens in order to further distinguish between "alien" under the INA and U.S. PERSON under Executive Order 12333. See INA § 101(a)(3) [8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(3)].

With our exception, asking to TST's authority, to tragest circumstances, only the IYD is authorized to reavivere dremable or intemational Intovists for inclusion in the TNDB or behalf of the Department of Justice. The IYD has implemented unlikely, governing the subversion of such resutintions, including perazitism to define when aiding, modifying, or deleting a TNDB record. In making any proposed recommendations for reanihilating, such IYD compenents do add reason that the underlying information is reasonably accurate, relevant and irredy, in addition, the TSC has implemented the Protocol Regarding Terrorist Conscienter. These policies must be followed regarding all insemntation from the "hypersmeat of Justice

The National JTTF was established in July 2002 to serve as the co-activating mechanism for the JTTFs.
5. Department of Justice components, other than the IYD or the TSC, are not permitted to make direct or intradivm to the TNDB. A Department of Justice compenent should
ration the appropriate JTTF through discussion and intelligence reports, electronic commanication, or other method upromement to the circumstances when it becomes aware of Gencral information, Terrorist Identifiers, or Health Densets. Terrorism information (unlicatively, intelligence information), The originating IOD component should state whether it recommends watch-listing the individual, the basis for that recommendation, and the investigation steps. If any, it has undertaken regarding the individual. If the JTTF determines that the information received from another component standing alone or in conjunction with other information known to the IYD exists the standards set forth in the Attoricy General's Guidelines 4-8 eproing a preliminary interview investigation or a full interview investigation and one has not been reared, the C.15. Staff initiate an investigation and shall constitute new subjects. In inclusion in TNDB and in the TNDB is

The purpose of this MtR is to set forth the metred understanding of the Parties to establish and implement a coordinated redace process to respond to irtalvidad complaints about all-cine experiences during terrorism screening that relate to the use of information contained on the government's consolidated database of known and suspected terrorism, known as the Terrorist Screering Database or TSDB. This MtR is intended to complement, and shall not be presented to certifier with, the Convention, atarion, or regulations of the United States or any Party's legal authority to process screening-related complaints or appeals. To the extent that any provision of this MtR's cormforts with any Party's legal authority for screening or to bear appeals, the conflicting provisions of this MtR shall not apply. This MtR's data not apply to irtalvidad complaints, or parts duceof, that pertain to screening experiences that are unrelated to the use of information contained in the TSDB.

Any reference to this MtR is a Party or Parties shall also be understood to refer to any components of such Party or Parties in the exent that such components did within the definition of separating agents, or maintaining-organizing agents, as set forth before, or that such components have been designated by the Paris or Parties as having obligations arising from this MtR. Nothing in this MtR precludes any Party from conducting periodic reviews of individuals in the TSDB to determine whether an individual should remain in the TSDB, have their TSDB status modified, or be removed from the TSDB. Nothing in this MtR shall be consrited to interfere with, limit, or impede any Party's ability to protect information that is classified pursuant to 1 secretive Order 12958, as amended, or is otherwise protected by law from disclosure.
As used in this MOC, these terms or phrases are defined as follows:
A. Complaint or Redress Complaint: An individual's statement about an allegedly adverse experience or outcome during a conscious screening process, which usually includes a request for assistance or a consult.
B. Occasional Submissioy: The information called upon or generated by a unminating/originating agency to support the nomination of an individual to the TSDR.
C. Known or Suspected Transcript: As defined by HSP3A4, an individual known or appropriately suspected to be or to have been engaged in conduct constituting, in preparation for, in aid of, or related to services. Pursuant to HSP3A4, the TSDR shall include identifying information about all known or suspected activities.
D. Abridaminal Person: An individual who has had an adverse experience or outcome during conscious screening because the individual is a near match to a known or suspected scenario in the TSDR. Misdare/Real persons are not actually listed in the TSDR but usually share an identical or very similar name and date of birth with a person in the TSDR, which causes them to be delayed or otherwise inconvenienced during screening.
E. Transmitter Source: A Federal agency that has determined that an individual is a known or suspected serorist and nominates that individual to the TSDR based on information that originated with that agency and/or a third agency.
F. Orientation Source: A Federal agency that generates derogatory or identifying information about a known or suspected serorist.

H. Redress: The process whereby an individual may seek the help of a screening agency in addressing the cause of an adverse experience or outcome related to the use of TSDR data by filing a complaint with the screening agency. The screening agency or its designus, in cooperation with UK and the nominating/originating agency, provides assistance by determining the cause of that adverse experience, verifying that all relevant information called upon in the screening process is thorough, accurate, and current, and making any warranted corrections to pertinent records. The redress process as defined in this paragraph does not apply to complaints related to the +ius application process.
I. Screening Agency: Any agency that conducts consistent screening. A screening agency acquires information for the process of determining whether an individual is a known or suspected serorist in the TSDR, and evaluates and/or uses that information in order to take a particular governmental action with respect to an individual, such as inquiring additional physical activity screening at an expert security checkpoint, determining admissibility into the United States, or similar
government action. The DHS and DHS shall not be considered screening agencies with respect to the vise application process.
3. Terrorism Sccommer The evaluation of an individual to determine whether he or she is a known or suspected terrorist identified in the TSDB in order to take a particular government action with respect to an individual, such as requiring additional physical security screening at an aimost security chockmim.
determining admissibility into the United States, or similar governmental action.

4. RESPONDING ITIES OF THE PARTICS

A. Recommendation of All Parties:
i. Desigmation of Responsible Official. Each Party will identify a senior official who will be responsible for ensuring the Party's full participation in the teileon process and overall compliance with this MOU. A Party may also designate redress officials for components of that Party that perform screening or nonstaining/originating agency functions. The Parties agree to identify these officials and exchange the names of these officials on later than 30 calendar days after this MOU becomes effective and update the information as needed thereafter.
ii. Revenues. Subject to the availability of funds, each Party will identify and consult, sometimes, staff and other resources in early out responsibilities under this MOU. This includes identifying the officials responsible for carrying out the Party's responsibilities pertaining to the processing of individual redress complaints as set forth in this MOU. The Parties agree to exchange the names and contact information for the responsible offices no later than 30 calendar days after this MOU becomes effective, and update the information as needed thereafter.
iii. Information Sharing. Each Party will share all information relevant to the resolution of a complaint with other Parties to the extent necessary or carry out this MOU or to defend any judicial challenge to the resolution of a complaint, consistent with legal requirements and classification and handling contents. A Party may provide the relevant information in a sensuoused or substituted format to protect sensitive sources and methods.
iv. Protection of Personally Identifiable Information. Each Party will take appropriate action to protect personally identifiable information (PN) in its own record systems related to a radion matter against unenfinnited access

![img-35.jpeg](img-35.jpeg)
trapen that the agencies consult with one another and share appropriate information about the watchfional tasks ideal in an attempt to provide a joint recommendation in TSC. If the nominating/originating agencies cannot agree to a joint recommendation TSC (or other agency with the legal authority to make the decision) will make the final determination considering the information provided by each agency.
41. Review Referral to Misinistrifical Pursues. If a complexion is adverse, sometimes an attempt during screening is a result of being a near-mouth ("unwistortified") as a record in the TSDB, and that complaint is referred to TSC by the screening agency, TSC will review the record in the TSDB, as described in the paragriphe above, to ensure the TSDB record is valid and satisfies the criteria for inclusion in the TSDB and determine if additional information can be added to TOF, the TSDB, or other agency systems to reduce the likelihood of a future misidentification. If the record does not meet the criteria, it will be removed from the TSDB.
411. Administrative Annals. TSC will work with a screening agency to assist it in processing any administrative appeal of a redress determination or other determination in which the TSDB was used. When TSC reaches notice of an appeal, TSC will notify NCTC and/or the nominating/originating agency as soon as possible, TSC will facilitate communication between the nominating/originating and screening agencies on the following issues: (1) determining what material may be releasable to the individual during appeal (if applicable), and (2) updating the analysis of any information that may have developed since the original determination and/or any information that was provided by the individual on the or her behalf during the appeals process itself. After reccieving the available information and considering any recommendation from the nominating/originating agency, TSC will make a determination whether the record should remain in the TSDB, have its TSDB status modified, or be removed, unless the legal authority to make such a determination similar, in whole or in part, with another agency. In such cases, TSC will only prepare a recommendation for the decision-making agency and will implement any determination once made.
412. Lifesions. When TSC becomes aware of litigation arising out of transition screening, TSC will notify NCTC, the nominating/originating agency, and 1831 as soon as possible.

# 13. Recommendation of the National Communication Center 

4. Bureau, Consideration, and Research of Compliance. I ipse receipt of a complaint from TSC, NCTC will review its holdings, notify the nominating/originating agency of the complaint, and provide the nominating/originating agency with a copy of the complaint for review.
NCTC will then request that the nominating/originating agency and, as appropriate, any other agency with relevant information, review their beldings and provide NCTC information relevant to the complaint. This may include method information or analysis regarding the complainant's patient status in the TSDR, derogatory information, identifying information that might be relevant to a misidentification, or other potentially relevant information or analysis (including that which tends to show that the individual is not a known or numerical anterior, or which otherwise tends to cast doubt on the derogatory information). NCTC will also request that the nominating/originating agency provide its recommendation regarding resolution of the complaint. With the concurrence of the nominating/originating agency, NCTC will provide that agency's recommendation and any other relevant information to TSC. Should TSC or another agency disagree with the recommendation, NCTC will assist in the decontiliation process as we both abuse. NCTC generally will not receive or process complaints or appeals for individuals nominated only by the FBI.
4. Review Related to Misidentified Persons. If a complainant's adverse experience or outcome during termitian screening was the result of being a near match ("misidentified") to a record in the TSDR, and that complaint is referred to TSC by the screening agency, NCTC will work with TSC and the nominating/originating agency to ensure the TSDR record is valid and satisfies the criteria for inclusion in the TSDR, and determine if additional information can be added to TIDE, the TSDR, or other agency systems to reduce the likelihood of a future misidentification.
5. Under of TIDE. NCTC will promptly update TIDE records with any new derogatory or other relevant information (including that which tends to show that the individual is not a known or numerical anterior, or which otherwise tends to cast doubt on the derogatory information) pertaining to individuals in the TSDR. NCTC will also modify TIDE in a timely fashion to reflect modifications in TSDR terminations resulting from a written complaint and will make appropriate changes to a given TIDE record when it is necessary to trigger electronically conforming changes to the TSDR record.
6. Administrative Sample. NCTC will work with TSC, as needed, to assist it in processing any administrative appeal of a written determination or other determination in which the TSDR was used, including coordinating communication between TSC, the screening agency, and the relevant nominating/originating agency, as necessary. NCTC's primary role will be to coordinate administrative appeal (sapems by TSC with the appropriate nominating/originating agency in the Intelligence Community other than the FBI.
1. Reproducibitios of Nominating Unifusting Acereies
2. Rerum, Localization, and Reaarch of Comitans. Once notified of a toiless complaint by TSC or NCTC, the nominating originating agency will review the derogatory information that is the basis for including the complainant in the TMM. In consideration with $\mathrm{SCIC}$, when appropriate, the nominating/organizing agency will evaluate whether the complainant continues to satisfy the criteria for inclusion in the TMM, as well as any other relevant criteria, such as those for the Red Ex and Schecter Law. The nominating originating agency will determine whether method information or such ex-cxtes, including information from other agencies, and incorporate any such information in its response. The nominating originating agency will also consider any information provided through the tedious process by the individual, the saviating agony, $\mathrm{SCIC}_{1}$, or TSC. The nominating originating agency shall take appropriate steps to modify, correct, or define its feelings to reflect any changes made in TIDC as a result of the tedious process, or that otherwise have been determined to be in error as a result of the tedious process.
3. Recommendation. The nominating/organizing agency may make a recommendation to TSC as to the resolution of any complaint. I outlined inclusion in the TMM must be supported by derogatory information in TIDC. When the nominating originating agency has additional derogatory or other relevant information that is not in TIDC, the nominating originating agency will ensure that $\mathrm{SCIC}_{1}$ and TSC are notified, and will work with $\mathrm{SCIC}_{2}$ and TSC to ensure that such information is added to TIDC in a manner that provides meaningful information while protecting women and methods. Every effort should be made, however, to share the derogatory information with TSC where or possible.
4. Quantification. In the event of a multi-agency nomination where the nominating and/or originating agencies do not agree on what recommendation should be made on a specific rulicess matter, the agency will consult with one another at TSC's request and share appropriate information about the watchflood individual in an attempt to provide a semi recommendation to TSC. If the nominating originating agencies cannot agree to a semi recommendation, TSC will make the final determination considering all of the available information.
5. Rerum Refined to Mentionified Persons. If a complainant's adverse experience during television screening was the result of being a near-reach ("mindenified") to a record in the TMM, the nominating originating agency of that record will work with TSC and NCTC, as appropriate, to ensure the TMM record is valid and satisfies the criteria for inclusion in the TMM, and if additional information can be added to TIDC, the TMM, or other agency systems to reduce the likelihood of a future mendenification.
1. Administrative Annals. Each nominating/originating agency will work with TSC and NCTC, as needed, to make them is processing an appeal of a serious determination or other determination in which the TSEB was used. The nominating/originating agency will be responsible for advising the screening agency on the telassability of any matarials requested by an apprelien during an appeal. An applied analysis of all relevant information will be coordinated between NCTC and the nominating/originating agency, and will be forwarded to TSC, which is now will provide it to the screening agency. The analysis will consider any new information developed since the initial determination, as well as any information provided by the individual on the or her own behalf during the apparts process itself.
2. Reassemblitics of the Department of Justice:
3. DOT will coordinate with the relevant Parties during the defense of any judicial challenge to the resolution of a complaint processed under the MOU or a determination by a screening agency that relied in whole or is part on records or information in the TSEB.
4. DOT will consult with the Parties, as necessary, to provide continuing legal advice and support on matters related to watchtaking redress and this MOU.
5. Vice Ameliorion Process, DOE and DOE Reassemblitics at the Time of Vice Refusal:
6. DOE and DOE will continue to comply with applicable vice procedures, which may include an at-past internal review by a supervisory consultar officer or another appropriate officials. While a consultor officer's denial of a vice application may not be, that determination is informed by an internal management review and, in appropriate cases, by input from an interagency review.
i. If a vice application is refused, applicates are advised that they may re apply for a case. A subsequent application is considered in a new case. DOE agrees to continue to review the underlying data and facts in such subsequent applications. Whatever appropriate, DOE consults with TSC, NCTC, and other agencies regarding data that appears incomplete or inaccurate, or otherwise conflicts with information obtained in the vice application process.

# 7. SETELMENT OF DISPOTES 

I'cept as set forth in paragraphs 4. C. 7 and 4. F. 24 concerning the decortification of watchtlar nominations, disagreements between the Parties arising under or related to this MOU will be resolved only by consultation between the Parties.
