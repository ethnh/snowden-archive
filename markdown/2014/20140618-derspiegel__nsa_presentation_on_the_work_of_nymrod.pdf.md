# Nymrod Mission 

## What analytic problems is Nymrod trying to address?

- We need to search for the target behind what's been extracted (find reported information about targeted persons)
- HUMAN beings are central to most targets
- We need to cope with linguistic variation among entity names (esp Person names)
- We need to resolve Entity "coreference" problems using contextual information ("Evidence")
