# (U) Two Types of Investigations 

## (S//RELTO USA, FVEY) Horizon Scanning

Objective: Initial identification and assessment
All source research
Answer the question: Does this technology appear to be a large risk to the SIGINT system? Why or why not?

## (S//RELTO USA, FVEY) Deep Dive

- Objective: Cause a funding decision(s)
- All source research; emphasis on geographic uptake trends; target uptake plans or vignettes.
Answer the question:Are SIGINT targets taking up this technology? How fast?
Implicitly contrast the above with the cost and time needed to remediate any SIGINT system shortfalls.
# (U) Trends and Forecasts: A Geo-temporal Tracking Problem 

![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)
> (u) Forecast:
"An estimation of a Future Condition" ...
> "To calculate or predict some future event or condition usually as a result of the analysis of available pertinent data" - Merriam Webster
> (U) Trend:
> "To extend in a general direction; follow a general course"

- Merriam Webster
> (u) By necessity, a trend-line requires measurement of understood variables across time.
# (U) Roaming Agreements 

![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)
$($ U) Allow a mobile subscriber to use resources on a visited network

- Each carrier's IR. 21 is a technical document that:
- Describes the operator itself in various ways
$\square$ Location, business codes, etc.
Describes access to the IP network of the operator
$\square$ DNS, IP addresses, ASN, etc.
Describes:
$\square$ Radio Access Network: technology(ies) type(s)
$\square$ Frequency(ies)
$\square$ Telephony routing information (MSISDN ranges; E.2I2)
$\square$ SCCP gateways (Point codes)
$\square$ Mobile Application Part protocol in use
$\square$ Hardware, software versions of certain network elements...
(S//RELTO USA, FVEY) Hypothesis: We can identify and track a carrier's technical evolution with IR. 21 and other data.

- Dates shown are standards completion dates (or expected completion dates.)
- "Initial VoIP" not as spectrally efficient as "Optimized VoIP".
- "Mobility" indicates when each particular standard supports mobility inter-operability between the terminal and BTS.
# (v) And What About 4G? 

![img-5.jpeg](img-5.jpeg)
(4) IMT-adv is an ITU led effort to set requirements for next gen. mobile networks

- Just as ITU's IMT-2000 defined 3G, ITU's IMT-adv will define 4G


## Proposed 3GPP Work Plan

![img-6.jpeg](img-6.jpeg)
# (v) Framework for Analysis... 

![img-7.jpeg](img-7.jpeg)
(u) 3GPP: Defines technology migration paths.
"Releases" - A Clear Technology Roadmap
$\square 3 G$ begins with Release 99
$\square$ Other releases: 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, ..... 10, II (future)
$\square$ See: www.3gpp.org/ftp/Information/WORK_PLAN/Description_Releases/
$\square$ Releases cover:
$\square$ Access: GSM, EDGE, HSPA, LTE, LTE-Advanced, etc.
$\square$ Core: GSM Core, Enhanced Packet Core...
$\square$ Services: MS, etc.
![img-8.jpeg](img-8.jpeg)
(v) GSMA: Defines carrier information exchange required to enable roaming
$\square$ Changes to IR. 21 format warn of imminent technology roll-out
$\square$ An IR. 21 is a GSMA-mandated document. IR. 21 are exchanged between Wireless operators with roaming agreements, to the GSMA, and to certain clearing house operations.
# (U) Analytic Process 

![img-9.jpeg](img-9.jpeg)
(S//RELTO USA, FVEY) Data analysis process is to match information in IR.2I, or elsewhere, against Releases in the Technology Roadmap

- Example: CAMEL Phase 4 (aka CAMEL4) as proxy for Release 5 deployment
- (S//RELTO USA, FVEY) Analytic goals:
- Establish a date-time for a release deployment
- Track releases at the per network level
- Display status at the national, regional, hemispheric or global scale
- Measure speed of adoption at each scale
- Identify early and late adopter tendencies by network
- (S//RELTO USA, FVEY) Deliverables:
- Adoption trends over time
- Forecasts derived from trends and framework changes
- Formal reporting of data and conclusions - as a dataset

(U) Various and sundry others ...
![img-13.jpeg](img-13.jpeg)
# (U) Information - Now What? 

![img-14.jpeg](img-14.jpeg)
> (S//REL to USA, FVEY) Make the data useable
Available in or out of the SIGINT production chain
> Attach flows to value-adding chains and processes
> Deliver as a data-set
> Recognize other data sets exist and also are part of analytic processes (federation anybody?)
> (S//RELTO USA, FVEY) Make the data traceable
> Includes auto-sourcing of data origin
> Time-stamping
> (S//RELTO USA, FVEY) T3C will do technology trending and warning...
> (U) Would your analytic processes benefit from this data set?
# (U) Your Invitation to Join 

![img-15.jpeg](img-15.jpeg)
(u) We are few; we welcome partnership.

- Can you help?
- Do you have a better way?
- Let's pull together!!
- (TS/SI/RELTO USA, FVEY) We are preparing to measure the breadth of our access to IR. 21 documents...
- Goals:
$\square$ Do we cover all 3GPP networks?
$\square$ Tweak access
$\square$ Tweak selectors
- Indexer will provide PWID for all identified IR.21, after dedupe.
