TOP SECRET STRAP 2 // REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL GCHQ metadata

- GCHQ now creating metadata on:
- SSL / TLS
- IKE
- OpenVPN
- SSH
- SQUEAL signatures (Various crypt packages)
- Data available in BEARDED PIGGY and/or the CLOUD
TOP SECRET STRAP 2 // REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL How can Network Analysis help?

- Can NAC help make sense using network knowledge of the volumes of data to isolate that which we want to decrypt...

# TOP SECRET STRAP 2 // REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL The Seed Approach 

- Intercepted documentation reveals details of VPN set up...

# TOP SECRET STRAP 2 // REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL The Seed Approach 

- Turn Seed IP into network block
- Query on network block against metadata
- Chain outwards / fuzzy subnet logic
- Basis of NTAT developed tradecraft:
- IRASCIBLE HARE
- IRASCIBLE RABBIT
- IRASCIBLE MOOSE
- IRASCIBLE EMITT
# TOP SECRET STRAP 2 // REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL Known usage 

- Target known to use encryption
- Identify target subnet
- Select on subnet against metadata
- Or...
- Start with an AS - look for most interesting wheel
- BELGACOM - AS6774 - known to run GRX links to MNO over VPN

TOP SECRET STRAP 2 // REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL Network Knowledge enrichment

- Internet Registry information
- IP Geolocation
- DNS
- Data derived from network device configuration files (routers/Firewalls etc)
- Network information on surrounding IPs (i.e. rest of subnet is MNO related)
# TOP SECRET STRAP 2 // REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL Access Optimisation 

- A given role of Network Analysis is optimising access for a given problem - in this case enabling two-ended collection
- Or..... Identifying opportunities to get at the data before it is encrypted therefore no need to make sense of encrypted data. Can do this both:
- Passive
- Active
# TOP SECRET STRAP 2 // REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL Your Idea's Please
