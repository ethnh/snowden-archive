- Priority time of legalities bodies
# TOP SECRET STRAP 2 <br> OP SOCIALIST Outcome 

- In MyNOC:
- CNE Access to BELGACOM - MERION ZETA - 6 endpoints into Engineer/support staff IP range
- 2 endpoints into BELGACOM DMZ (from prep VA work)
- Optimal Bearers identified providing good access to BELGACOM proxy.
- Post MyNOC:
- Optimal Bearers continue to allow QI against BELGACOM engineers/proxy
- Internal CNE access continues to expand - getting close to access core GRX Routers - currently on hosts with access
- NAC continue to support with Network Analysis of internal networks, network understanding research on credentials and identification of engineers/system administrators and their specific roles.
![img-9.jpeg](img-9.jpeg)

- Focused working in small groups
- Regular Brainstorming sessions
- Professional Operational Management
- Network becomes Target - Target approach to Network Problems
- Awareness of JTRIG and Open-source information specialist capabilities and how they can support Network Analysis.
- Steerage of access for Network Analysis gain
- Closer working between NAC and CNE
- Joint working between NACs
- More NAC MyNOC/Focus efforts to come....
