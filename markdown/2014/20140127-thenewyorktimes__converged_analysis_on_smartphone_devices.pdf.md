# Taking a Closer Look 

## Photo Capture Software -

- iPhone Geotags for Photos

Raw tags coming through from a variety of devices

- Flixster App uses GPRS
- Flickr/Photobucket
- Mobile Facebook Apps Uploads
# Processing 

All in the Metadata, not the pretty pictures

- Unique applications require unique analysis
- GPS Indicators (sent to the server and towers for both phone and application)
- VoIP Indicators (multiple services)
- Type of Phone and Apps

# Identification via Xkeyscore 

- Make use of fingerprints in Xkeyscore via the EXIF metadata plugin
- Fingerprints for images (jpeg, tiff, gifts etc.)
- Examine the raw XML
- Provides device and time/location for the image
# Golden Nugget! 

## Perfect Scenario - Target uploading photo to a social media site taken with a mobile device.

What can we get?
