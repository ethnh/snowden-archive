# Future Plans (U) 

(TS//SI//REL) In the future, MSOC hopes to expand the number of WORDGOPHER platforms to enable demodulation of thousands of additional low-rate carriers.

These
targets are ideally suited for software demodulation. Additionally, MSOC has developed a capability to automatically scan and demodulate signals as they activate on the satellites. There are a multitude of possibilities, bringing our enterprise one step closer to "collecting it all."

(S//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) SHELLTRUMPET Processes it|'s One Trillionth Metadata Record

By NAME REDACTED
on 2012-12-31 0738
(S//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) On December 21, 2012 SHELLTRUMPET processed its One Trillionth metadata record. SHELLTRUMPET began as a near-real-time metadata analyzer on Dec 8, 2007 for a CLASSIC collection system. In its five year history, numerous other systems from across the Agency have come to use SHELLTRUMPET's processing capabilities for performance monitoring, direct E-Mail tip alerting, TRAFFICTHIEF tipping, and Real-Time Regional Gateway (RTRG) filtering and ingest. Though it took five years to get to the one trillion mark, almost half of this volume was processed in this calendar year, and half of that volume was from SSO's DANCINGOASIS. SHELLTRUMPET is currently processing Two Billion call events/day from select SSO (Ram-M, OAKSTAR, MYSTIC and NCSC enabled systems), MUSKETEER, and Second Party systems. We will be expanding its reach into other SSO systems over the course of 2013. The Trillion records processed have resulted in over 35 Million tips to TRAFFICTHIEF.

SILVERZEPHYR FAA DNI Access Initiated at NSAW (TS//SI//NF)
By NAME REDACTED
on 2009-11-06 0918
(TS//SI//NF) On Thursday, 11/5/09, the SSO-OAKSTAR SILVERZEPHYR (SZ) access began forwarding FAA DNI records to NSAW via the FAA WealthyCluster2/Tellurian system installed at the partner's site. SSO coordinated with the Data Flow Office and forwarded numerous sample files to a test partition for validation, which was completely successful. SSO will continue to monitor the flow and collection to ensure a ny anomalies are identified and corrected as required. SILVERZEPHYR will continue to provide customers with authorized, transit DNR collection. SSO is working with the partner to gain access to an additional 80Gbs of DNI data on their peering network, bundled in 10 Gbs increments. The OAKSTAR team, along with support from NSAT and GNDA, just completed a 12 day SIGINT survey at site, which identified over 200 new links. During the survey, GNDA worked with the partner to test the output of their ACS system. OAKSTAR is also working with NSAT to examine snapshots taken by the partner in Brazil and Colombia, both of which may contain internal communications for those countries.

Complete list and details on PRISM web page:
![img-16.jpeg](img-16.jpeg)
(TS//SI//NF) PRISM (US-984XN) expanded its impact on NSA's reporting mission in FY12 through increased tasking, collection and operational improvements. Here are some highlights of the FY12 PRISM program:

PRISM is the most cited collection source in NSA 1st Party end-product reporting. More NSA product reports were based on PRISM than on any other single SIGAD for all of NSA's 1st Party reporting during FY12: cited in $15.1 \%$ of all reports (up from $14 \%$ in FY11). PRISM was cited in $13.4 \%$ of all 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Party NSA reporting (up from 11.9\% in FY11), and is also the top cited SIGAD overall

Number of PRISM-based end-product reports issued in FY12: 24,096, up $27 \%$ from FY11

Single-source reporting percentage in FY12 and FY11: 74\%
Number of product reports derived from PRISM collection and cited as sources in articles in the President's Daily Brief in FY12: 1,477 (18\% of all SIGINT reports cited as sources in PDB articles - highest single SIGAD for NSA); In FY11: 1,152 (15\% of all SIGINT reports cited as sources in PDB articles - highest single SIGAD for NSA)

Number of Essential Elements of Information contributed to in FY12: 4,186 (32\% of all EEIs for all Information Needs); 220 EEIs addressed solely by PRISM

Tasking: The number of tasked selectors rose $32 \%$ in FY12 to 45,406 as of Sept 2012

Great success in Skype collection and processing; unique, high value targets acquired

Expanded PRISM taskable e-mail domains from only 40, to 22,000
(TS//SI//NF) SSO HIGHLIGHT - Microsoft Skydrive Collection Now Part of PRISM Standard Stored Communications Collection

By NAME REDACTED
on 2013-03-08 1500
(TS//SI//NF) Beginning on 7 March 2013, PRISM now collects Microsoft Skydrive data as part of PRISM's standard Stored Communications collection package for a tasked FISA Amendments Act Section 702 (FAA702) selector. This means that analysts will no longer have to make a special request to SSO for this - a process step that many analysts may not have known about. This new capability will result in a much more complete and timely collection response from SSO for our Enterprise customers. This success is the result of the FBI working for many months with Microsoft to get this tasking and collection solution established. "SkyDrive is a cloud service that allows users to store and access their files on a variety of devices. The utility also includes free web app support for Microsoft Office programs, so the user is able to create, edit, and view Word, PowerPoint, Excel files without having MS Office actually installed on their device." (source: S314 wiki)
(TS//SI//NF) New Skype Stored Comms Capability For PRISM
By NAME REDACTED on 2013-04-03 0631
(TS//SI//NF) PRISM has a new collection capability: Skype stored communications. Skype stored communications will contain unique data which is not collected via normal real-time surveillance collection. SSO expects to receive buddy lists, credit card info, call data records, user account info, and other material. On 29 March 2013, SSO forwarded approximately 2000 Skype selectors for stored communications to be adjudicated in SV41 and the Electronic Communications Surveillance Unit (ECSU) at FBI. SV41 had been working on adjudication for the highest priority selectors ahead of time and had about 100 ready for ECSU to evaluate. It could take several weeks for SV41 to work through all 2000 selectors to get them approved, and ECSU will likely take longer to grant the approvals. As of 2 April, ESCU had approved over 30 selectors to be sent to Skype for collection. PRISM Skype collection has carved out a vital niche in NSA reporting in less than two years with terrorism, Syrian opposition and regime, and exec/special series reports being the top topics. Over 2800 reports have been issued since April 2011 based on PRISM Skype collection, with $76 \%$ of them being single source.
(TS//SI//NF) SSO Expands PRISM Skype Targeting Capability
By NAME REDACTED
on 2013-04-03 0629
(TS//SI//NF) On 15 March 2013, SSO's PRISM program began tasking all Microsoft PRISM selectors to Skype because Skype allows users to log in using account identifiers in addition to Skype usernames. Until now, PRISM would not collect any Skype data when a user logged in using anything other than the Skype username which resulted in missing collection; this action will mitigate that. In fact, a user can create a Skype account using any e-mail address with any domain in the world. UTT does not currently allow analysts to task these non-Microsoft e-mail addresses to PRISM, however, SSO intends to fix that this summer. In the meantime, NSA, FBI and Dept of Justice coordinated over the last six months to gain approval for PRINTAURA to send all current and future Microsoft PRISM selectors to Skype. This resulted in about 9800 selectors being sent to Skype and successful collection has been received which otherwise would have been missed.
(TS//SI//NF) Microsoft releases new service, affects FAA 702 collection
By NAME REDACTED
on 2012-12-26 0811
(TS//SI//NF) On 31 July, Microsoft (MS) began encrypting web-based chat with the introduction of the new outlook.com service. This new Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption effectively cut off collection of the new service for FAA 702 and likely 12333 (to some degree) for the Intelligence Community (IC). MS, working with the FBI, developed a surveillance capability to deal with the new SSL. These solutions were successfully tested and went live 12 Dec 2012. The SSL solution was applied to all current FISA and 702/PRISM requirements - no changes to UTT tasking procedures were required. The SSL solution does not collect server-based voice/video or file transfers. The MS legacy collection system will remain in place to collect voice/video and file transfers. As a result there will be some duplicate collection of text-based chat from the new and legacy systems which will be addressed at a later date. An increase in collection volume as a result of this solution has already been noted by CES.
(TS//SI//NF) Expanding PRISM Sharing With FBI and CIA
$\underbrace{\text { By }}_{\text {NAME REDACTED }} \underbrace{\text { NAMEREDACTED }}$ on 2012-08-31 0947
(TS//SI//NF) Special Source Operations (SSO) has recently expanded sharing with the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) on PRISM operations via two projects. Through these efforts, SSO has created an environment of sharing and teaming across the Intelligence Community on PRISM operations. First, SSO's PRINTAURA team solved a problem for the Signals Intelligence Directorate (SID) by writing software which would automatically gather a list of tasked PRISM selectors every two weeks to provide to the FBI and CIA. This enables our partners to see which selectors the National Security Agency (NSA) has tasked to PRISM. The FBI and CIA then can request a copy of PRISM collection from any selector, as allowed under the 2000 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) Amendments Act law. Prior to PRINTAURA's work, SID had been providing the FBI and CIA with incomplete and inaccurate lists, preventing our partners from making full use of the PRISM program. PRINTAURA volunteered to gather the detailed data related to each selector from multiple locations and assemble it in a usable form. In the second project, the PRISM Mission Program Manager (MPM) recently began sending operational PRISM news and guidance to the FBI and CIA so that their analysts could task the PRISM system properly, be aware of outages and changes, and optimize their use of PRISM. The MPM coordinated an agreement from the SID Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Amendments Act (FAA) Team to share this information weekly, which has been well-received and appreciated. These two activities underscore the point that PRISM is a team sport!

Information Paper

Subject: (U//FOUO) NSA Intelligence Relationship with Canada's Communications Security Establishment Canada (CSEC)

TÓP SECRET//SI//REL TO USA, CAN
(U) What NSA provides to the partner:
(SI/SI//REL TO USA, CAN) SIGINT-NSA and CSEC-coveries in two-time, approximately 20 high-priority countries

NSA shares technological developments, cryptologic capabilities, software and resources for state-of-the-art collection, processing and analytic efforts, and IA capabilities. The intelligence exchange with CSEC covers worldwide national and transnational targets. No Consolidated Cryptologic Program (CCP) money is allocated to CSEC, but NSA at times pays R\&D and technology costs on shared projects with CSEC.
(U) What the partner provides to NSA:
(TSI/SI//REL TO USA, CAN) CSEC offers resources for advanced collection, processing and analysis, and has opened covert sites at the request of NSA. CSEC shares with NSA their unique geographic access to areas unavailable to the U.S. and the U.S. and the U.S. and provides cryptographic products, cryptanalysis, technology, and software. CSEC has increased its investment in R\&D projects of mutual interest.
While we have invested significant analytic and collection effort of our own to find and exploit these communications, the difficulties we face in obtaining regular and reliable access to such communications impacts on our ability to detect and prevent terrorist acts and diminishes our capacity to protect the life and safety of Australian citizens and those of our close friends and allies.

We have enjoyed a long and very productive partnership with NSA in obtaining minimised access to United States warranted collection against our highest value terrorist targets in Indonesia. This access has been critical to DSD's efforts to disrupt and contain the operational capabilities of terrorists in our region as highlighted by the recent arrest of fugitive Bali bomber Umar Patek.

We would very much welcome the opportunity to extend that partnership with NSA to cover the increasing number of Australians involved in international extremist activities - in particular Australians involved with AQAP.

# FAD FY 12 CCP Funding of Partners 

In Thousands of USD
![img-19.jpeg](img-19.jpeg)
(TS//SI//REL) There are also a few surprises... France targets the US DoD through technical intelligence collection, and Israel also targets us. On the one hand, the Israelis are extraordinarily good SIGINT partners for us, but on the other, they target us to learn our positions on Middle East problems. A NIE [National Intelligence Estimate] ranked them as the third most aggressive intelligence service against the US.
Balancing the SIGINT exchange equally between US and Israeli needs has been a constant challenge in the last decade, it arguably tilted heavily in favor of Israeli security concerns. 9/11 came, and went, with NSA's only true Third Party CT relationship being driven almost totally by the needs of the partner.
# Applications Made to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court During Calendar Year 2012 (section 107 of the Act, 50 U.S.C. § 1807) 

During calendar year 2012, the Government made 1,856 applications to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (the "FISC") for authority to conduct electronic surveillance and/or physical searches for foreign intelligence purposes. The 1,856 applications include applications made solely for electronic surveillance, applications made solely for physical search, and combined applications requesting authority for electronic surveillance and physical search. Of these, 1,789 applications included requests for authority to conduct electronic surveillance.

Of these 1,789 applications, one was withdrawn by the Government. The FISC did not deny any applications in whole or in part.

(S//SI) BLARNEY Team Provides Outstanding Support to Enable UN Security Council Collection

By
NAME REDACTED
on 2010-05-28 1430
(TS//SI//NF) With the UN vote on sanctions against Iran approaching and several countries riding the fence on making a decision, Ambassador Rice reached out to NSA requesting SIGINT on those countries so that she could develop a strategy. With the requirement that this be done rapidly and within our legal authorities, the BLARNEY team jumped in to work with organizations and partners both internal and external to NSA.
(TS//SI//NF) As OGC, SV and the TOPIs aggressively worked through the legal paperwork to expedite four new NSA FISA court orders for Gabon, Uganda, Nigeria and Bosnia, BLARNEY Operations Division personnel were behind the scenes gathering data determining what survey information was available or could be obtained via their long standing FBI contacts. As they worked to obtain information on both the UN Missions in NY and the Embassies in DC, the target development team greased the skids with appropriate data flow personnel and all preparations were made to ensure data could flow to the TOPIs as soon as possible. Several personnel, one from legal team and one from target development team were called in on Saturday 22 May to support the 24 hour drill legal paperwork exercise doing their part to ensure the orders were ready for the NSA Director's signature early Monday morning 24 May.
(S//SI) With OGC and SV pushing hard to expedite these four orders, they went from the NSA Director for signature to DoD for SECDEF signature and then to DOJ for signature by the FISC judge in record time. All four orders were signed by the judge on Wednesday 26 May! Once the orders were received by the BLARNEY legal team, they sprung into action parsing these four orders plus another "normal" renewal in one day. Parsing five court orders in one day - a BLARNEY record! As the BLARNEY legal team was busily parsing court orders the BLARNEY access management team was working with the FBI to pass tasking information and coordinate the engagement with telecommunications partners.

## (U//FOUO) Silent Success: SIGINT Synergy Helps Shape US Foreign Policy

(TS//SI//NF) At the outset of these lengthy negotiations, NSA had sustained collection against France
Japan, Mexico, Brazil
(TS//SI//REL) In late spring 2010, eleven branches across five Product Lines teamed with NSA enablers to provide the most current and accurate information to USUN and other customers on how UNSC members would vote on the Iran Sanctions Resolution. Noting that Iran continued its noncompliance with previous UNSC resolutions concerning its nuclear program, the UN imposed further sanctions on 9 June 2010. SIGINT was key in keeping USUN informed of how the other members of the UNSC would vote.
(TS//SI//REL) The resolution was adopted by twelve votes for, two against (Brazil and Turkey), and one abstention from Lebanon. According to USUN, SIGINT "helped me to know when the other Permreps [Permanent Representatives] were telling the truth.... revealed their real position on sanctions... gave us an upper hand in negotiations... and provided information on various countries 'red lines.'"
