## (U) Stealthy Techniques Can Crack Some of SIGINT's Hardest Targets

By: (U//FOUO) NAME REDACTED, Chief, Access and Target Development (S3261)
(TS//SI//NF) Not all SIGINT tradecraft involves accessing signals and networks from thousands of miles away... In fact, sometimes it is very hands-on (literally!). Here's how it works: shipments of computer network
![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
devices (servers, routers, etc.) being delivered to our targets throughout the world are intercepted. Next, they are redirected to a secret location where Tailored Access Operations/Access Operations (AO - S326) employees, with the support of the Remote Operations Center (S321), enable the installation of beacon implants directly into our targets' electronic devices. These devices are then re-packaged and placed back into transit to the original destination. All of this happens with the support of Intelligence Community partners and the technical wizards in TAO.
(TS//SI//NF) Such operations involving supply-chain interdiction are some of the most productive operations in TAO, because they pre-position access points into hard target networks around the world.

(TS//SI//NF) Left: Intercepted packages are opened carefully; Right: A "load station" implants a beacon
(TS//SI//NF) In one recent case, after several months a beacon implanted through supplychain interdiction called back to the NSA covert infrastructure. This call back provided us access to further exploit the device and survey the network.

Reason for Change:
Mission Impact:

All of our Cisco ONS SONET multiplexers are experiencing a software bug that causes them to intermittently drop out.
The mission impact is unknown. While the existing bug doesn't appear to affect traffic, applying the new software update could. Unfortunately, there is now way to be sure. We can't simulate the bug in our lab and so it's impossible to predict exactly what will happen when we apply the software update. We propose to update one of the nodes in NBP-320 first to determine if the update goes smoothly.

Recently we tried to reset the standby manager card in the HOMEMAKER node. When that failed, we attempted to physically resed it. Since it was the standby card, we did not expect that would cause any problems. However, upon reseating the card, the entire ONS crashed and we lost all traffic through the box. It took more than an hour to recover from this failure.

The worst case scenario is that we have to blow away the entire configuration and start from scratch. Prior to starting our upgrade, we will save the configuration so that if we have to configure the box from scratch, we can simply uploade the saved configuration. We estimate that we will be down for no more than an hour for each node in the system.

Programs Affected:

3/26/2013 8:16:13 AM

We have tested the upgrade in our lab and it works well. However, we can't repeat the bug in our lab, so we don't know if we will encounter problems when we attempt to upgrade a node that is affected by the bug.

# Why are we interested in HTTP? 

## facebook

Because nearly everything a typical user does on the Internet uses HTTP
![img-5.jpeg](img-5.jpeg)
# Why are we interested in HTTP? 

- Almost all web-browsing uses HTTP:
- Internet surfing
- Webmail (Yahoo/Hotmail/Gmail/etc.)
- OSN (Facebook/MySpace/etc.)
- Internet Searching (Google/Bing/etc.)
- Online Mapping (Google Maps/Mapquest/etc.)
# XKS HTTP Activity Search 

Another common query is analysts who want to see all traffic from a given IP address (or IP addresses) to a specific website.
# XKS HTTP Activity Search 

- For example let's say we want to see all traffic from IP Address 1.2.3.4 to the website www.website.com
- While we can just put the IP address and the "host" into the search form, remember what we saw before about the various host names for a given website

## Email Addresses Query:

One of the most common queries is (you guessed it) an Email Address Query searching for an email address. To create a query for a specific email address, you have to fill in the name of the query, justify it and set a date range then you simply fill in the email address(es) you want to search on and submit.

That would look something like this...

(TS//SI//NF) BLARNEY Exploits the Social Network via Expanded Facebook Collection

By NAME REDACTED
on 2011-03-14 0737
(TS//SI//NF) SSO HIGHLIGHT - BLARNEY Exploits the Social Network via Expanded Facebook Collection
(TS//SI//NF) On 11 March 2011, BLARNEY began delivery of substantially improved and more complete Facebook content. This is a major leap forward in NSA's ability to exploit Facebook using FISA and FAA authorities. This effort was initiated in partnership with the FBI six months ago to address an unreliable and incomplete Facebook collection system. NSA is now able to access a broad range of Facebook data via surveillance and search activities. OPIs are excited about receiving many content fields, such as chat, on a sustained basis that had previously only been occasionally available. Some content will be completely new including subscriber videos. Taken together, the new Facebook collection will provide a robust SIGINT opportunity against our targets - from geolocation based on their IP addresses and user agent, to collection of all of their private messages and profile information. Multiple elements across NSA partnered to ensure the successful delivery of this data. An NSA representative at FBI coordinated the rapid development of the collection system; SSO's PRINTAURA team wrote new software and made configuration changes; CES modified their protocol exploitation systems and the Technology Directorate fasttracked upgrades to their data presentation tools so that OPIs could view the data properly.

- Many targets on Facebook lock down their profiles, so it is not possible to view all of their information...


## But passive offers the opportunity to collect this information by exploiting inherent weaknesses in Facebook's security model.

## Oh Yeah...

- Put Money, National Interest, and Ego together, and now you' re talking about shaping the world writ large.

What country doesn't want to make the world a better place... for itself?
# SECRET//REL TO USA, FVEY 

## What's the Threat?

Let's be blunt - the Western World (especially the US) gained influence and made a lot of money via the drafting of earlier standards.
$\square$ The US was the major player in shaping today's Internet. This resulted in pervasive exportation of American culture as well as technology. It also resulted in a lot of money being made by US entities.
![img-15.jpeg](img-15.jpeg)
# BACKGROUND (U) 

(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) A previous SIGINT assessment report on radicalization indicated that radicalizers appear to be particularly vulnerable in the area of authority when their private and public behaviors are not consistent. (A) Some of the vulnerabilities, if exposed, would likely call into question a radicalizer's devotion to the jihadist cause, leading to the degradation or loss of his authority. Examples of some of these vulnerabilities include:

- Viewing sexually explicit material online or using sexually explicit persuasive language when communicating with inexperienced young girls;
- Using a portion of the donations they are receiving from the susceptible pool to defray their own personal expenses;
- Charging an exorbitant amount of money for their speaking fees and being singularly attracted by opportunities to increase their stature; or
- Being known to base their public messaging on questionable sources or using language that is contradictory in nature, leaving them open to credibility challenges.
(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Issues of trust and reputation are important when considering the validity and appeal of the message. It stands to reason that exploiting vulnerabilities of character, credibility, or both, of the radicalizer and his message could be enhanced by an understanding of the vehicles he uses to disseminate his message to the susceptible pool of people and where he is vulnerable in terms of access.

(U) The following manhunting operations took place in Calendar Year 2010:

## [edit] (U) November

## Contents

## [edit] (U) United States, Australia, Great Britain, Germany, Iceland

(U) The United States on 10 August urged other nations with forces in Afghanistan, including Australia, United Kingdom, and Germany, to consider filing criminal charges against Julian Assange, founder of the rogue Wikileaks Internet website and responsible for the unauthorized publication of over 70,000 classified documents covering the war in Afghanistan. The documents may have been provided to Wikileaks by Army Private First Class Bradley Manning. The appeal exemplifies the start of an international effort to focus the legal element of national power upon non-state actor Assange, and the human network that supports Wikileaks. ${ }^{[16]}$
# [edit] (TS//SI//REL) Malicious foreign actor == disseminator of US data? 

Can we treat a foreign server who stores, or potentially disseminates leaked or stolen US data on it's server as a 'malicious foreign actor' for the purpose of targeting with no defeats? Examples: WikiLeaks, thepiratebay.org, etc.

## [edit] (TS//SI//REL) Unknowingly targeting a US person

I screwed up...the selector had a strong indication of being foreign, but it turned out to be US...now what?

NOC/OGC RESPONSE: With all querying, if you discover it actually is US, then it must be submitted and go in the OGC quarterly report...'but it's nothing to worry about'. (Source \#001)
