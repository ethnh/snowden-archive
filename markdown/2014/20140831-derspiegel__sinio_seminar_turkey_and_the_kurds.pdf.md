# (U) Course Overview: 

(C) "Turkish Cross-Border Operations and Kurdish Intifada: Rhetoric or Reality?"

Increasing threats and attacks by the terrorist group Kongra Gel (former PKK) in Turkish urban areas and tourist locations, mounting Turkish pressure for action against Kongra Gel camps and leadership in northern Iraq, and prolonged unrest in mostly Kurdish southeastern Turkey this spring have the attention of senior U.S. policymakers. Chronic Turkish government failure to address the underlying grievances of its Kurdish population provides an environment that supports Kongra Gel's ability to constitute a serious security threat for Turkey and pose a serious challenge for U.S. policymakers as unilateral Turkish military action in northern Iraq is a hotbutton (nightmare) issue for the United States. Is Turkish cross-border action likely? Can Kongra Gel make good on its threats of wider attacks? Who are the Kurdistan Freedom Hawks? Why did the social unrest and riots in March occur? Will they persist? What role does Kongra Gel play? How does the Intelligence Community assess these issues? What role does SIGINT play?
