Direct, high-level tasking

- Where active tasking already in use, refine what is collected
- If no CNE, pursue active collection

Note: Our goals for high-level tasking are to relieve the user from needing to know / care about the details. For example, a user should be able to ask for "all details about application X" and not need to know how and where the application keeps files, registry entries, user application data, etc.
