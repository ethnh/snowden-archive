# 8BBAC <br> JORDAN-BELGIUM 

Report No: 44 Date: 01/12/2008
Case Notation: 8BBAC
Polarity/Freq: 8BL Mhz
Summary:
This informal report has been issued to highlight a link of potential interest for tasking.
The physical gateways are JORDAN-BELGIUM, however BELGIUM is providing a logical gateway to the ROW.

The link is a fairly standard E1 employing Timeslots 30 and 31 to relay C7, which in turn provides the dialling for this link. Compression is achieved by utilising DTX-360B DCME equipment.

Traffic summaries indicate that both terminals are relaying transit data.
