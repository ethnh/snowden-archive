# [edit] News 

BREAKING NEWS (May 2012) - The second tranche of 'deep dive' processing capability at RPC has gone live. In addition 2 extra 10G's are being processed at OPC. This brings the current 'deep dive' capability to:

- CPC with $16 \times 10 \mathrm{~g}$,
- OPC with $7 \times 10 \mathrm{~g}$
- RPC1 with $23 \times 10 \mathrm{~g}$.

This gives over 300 GCHQ and $\sim 250$ NSA analysts access to huge amounts of data to support the target discovery mission.

The MTI programme would like to say a big thanks to everyone who has made this possible (Which includes MTI TGA, TEA, SSMC, SSOS, GTE, ACD, OPP-LEC, IT Services, R1 at NSA, AHS and ) - a true collaborative effort!

TEMPORA was delivered by the MTI Enhanced Discovery swimlane, led by

## [edit] TEMPORA

TEMPORA is an Internet Buffer capability being delivered by MTI, IPP and GTE for joint mission benefit. It builds upon the key success of the TINT experiment and will provide a vital unique
capability to MISD/MCE communities.

- TEMPORA is the codeword for GCHQs internet buffer business capability as a whole - which is the ability to loosely promote a ¾ of traffic across GCHQs SSE access into a repository which will keep the content (and its associated metadata) for periods of time (approximately 3 days for content and up to 30 days for metadata) to allow retrospective analysis and forwarding to follow on systems.
- TEMPORA as a capability is agnostic of the technologies used to promote that traffic and to store that traffic and so should not be used as a codeword for the individual components (e.g XKS, MVR etc).
- At the moment the components include, amongst others, GCHQ SSE Access, POKERFACE sanitisation, XKS (in various configurations) and it will include MVR in the very near future.
- TEMPORA also covers the management of the rules used to promote traffic into the internet buffer capability.
- TEMPORA is not processing centre specific. At the moment there are instances of TEMPORA at all xPC (Namely CPC, OPC and RPC1). These should be referred to, when required, as OPC/CPC/RPC1 TEMPORA


# [edit] A bit more detail 

TEMPORA are GCHQ's large-scale, Deep Dive deployments on Special Source access (SSE). Deep Dive XKeyscores work by promoting loose categories of traffic (e.g., all web, email, social, chat, EA, VPN, VoIR...) from the bearers feeding the system and block all the high-volume, low value traffic (e.g., P2P downloads). This usually equates to $\sim 30 \%$ of the traffic on the bearer. We keep the full sessions for 3 working days and the metadata for 30 days for you to query, using all the functionality that Keyscore offers to slice and dice the data. The aim is to put the best $7.5 \%$ of our access into TEMPORA's, comprising a mix of Deep Dive Keyscores and promotion of data based on IP subset or technology type from across the entire MVR. At the moment, users are able to access 46 x 10 Gs of data via existing Internet Buffers.. This is a lot of data! Not only that, but the long-running TINT program and our initial 3-month operational trial of the CPC Internet Buffer (the first operational Internet Buffer to be deployed) show that every area of ops can get real benefit from this capability, especially for target discovery and target development. Internet Buffers are different from TINT in that the latter is purely an experimental, research environment whereas Internet Buffers can be used operationally for EPR, Effects, enabling CNE etc.
