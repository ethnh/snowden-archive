| 1. (U) The fact that NSA/CSS exploits cryptographic information security devices and systems. | UNCLASSIFIED | N/A | N/A |  |
| 2. (C) The fact that NSA/CSS works with Second Party partners on exploiting cryptographic information security devices and systems. | CONFIDENTIAL | $1.4(\mathrm{c})$ | 20291123 |  |
| 3. (S) The fact that NSA/CSS works with unspecified Third Party partners on exploiting cryptographic information security devices and systems. | SECRET | $1.4(\mathrm{c})$ | 20291123 |  |
| 4. (U) The fact that NSA/CSS exploits unintended cryptographic vulnerabilities in commercial or indigenous information security devices and systems, as long as neither the vulnerability nor the targeted device/ system is identified. | UNCLASSIFIED | N/A | N/A |  |
| 5. (TS//SI) The fact that NSA/CSS makes cryptographic modifications to commercial or indigenous cryptographic information security devices or systems in order to make them exploitable. | $\begin{gathered} \text { TOP SECRET// } \\ \text { COMINT } \\ \text { at a minimum } \end{gathered}$ | $1.4(\mathrm{c})$ | 20291123 | (U) Specifying the specific system is protected by an ECL. |
| 6. (U) The fact that NSA/CSS has cryptanalytic techniques to exploit cryptographic components of commercial or indigenous information security devices or systems. | UNCLASSIFIED | N/A | N/A | (U) Additional details will raise the classification and may be protected by an ECI. |
| 7. (C) The fact that NSA/CSS has the ability to recover cryptovariables used to exploit commercial or indigenous cryptographic information security devices or systems. | CONFIDENTIAL | $1.4(\mathrm{c})$ | 20291123 | (C) Details of CV recovery are protected by an ECI. <br> (C) Specifying a specific system for which we can recovery CVs is protected by an ECI. |

| 8. (U) The fact that NSA/CSS successfully exploits cryptographic components of commercial or indigenous cryptographic information security devices or systems without specifying the device or system. | UNCLASSIFIED | N/A | N/A | (U) Additional details will require the classification and may be protected by an ECI. |
| 9. (U//FOUO) The fact that NSA/CSS successfully exploits cryptographic components of commercial or indigenous cryptographic information security devices or systems when the device or system is specified. | TOP SECRET// <br> COMINT <br> at a minimum | $1.4(\mathrm{c})$ | 20291123 | (U) Additional details may be protected by an ECI. |
| 10. (TS) The fact that NSA/CSS obtains cryptographic details of commercial cryptographic information security systems through industry relationships. | TOP SECRET at a minimum | $1.4(\mathrm{c})$ | 20291123 | (C) Identification of the system or company is protected as COMINT and ECI. |

# (U) DEFINITIONS: 

(U//FOUO) Information security device or system: A device or system that provides any of the following services for communications or information systems: confidentiality, data integrity, authentication and authorization.
(U//FOUO) Cryptanalytic vulnerability: A flaw in the design, implementation or system integration of cryptography used in an information security device, or a flaw in the way that a cryptographic information security device is used.
(U//FOUO) Unintended cryptographic vulnerability: Security is less than advertised by the manufacturer.
(U//FOUO) Indigenous: Non-commercial cryptographic information security system or device developed by a SIGINT target.
