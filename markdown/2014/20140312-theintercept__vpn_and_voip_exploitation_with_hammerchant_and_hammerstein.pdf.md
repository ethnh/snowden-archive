# APEX VPN Phases 

## - VPN Phase 1: IKE Metadata Only (Spin 15)

- IKE packets are exfiled to TURMOIL APEX.
- APEX reconstructs/reinjects IKE packets to the TURMOIL VPN components.
- TURMOIL VPN extracts metadata from each key exchange and sends to the CES TOYGRIPPE metadata database. This database is used by SIGDEV analysts to identify potential targets for further exploitation.
- VPN Phase 2: Targeted IKE Forwarding (Spin 15)
- TURMOIL VPN looks up IKE packet IP addresses in KEYCARD.
- If either IP address is targeted, the key exchange packets are forwarded to the CES Attack Orchestrator (POISON NUT) for VPN key recovery.
- VPN Phase 3: Static Tasking of ESP
- HAMMERSTEIN receives static tasking to exfil targeted ESP packets.
- APEX reconstructs/reinjects ESP packets to the TURMOIL VPN components.
- TURMOIL VPN requests VPN key from CES and attempts decryption.
- VPN Phase 4: Dynamic Targeting of ESP
- Based on the value returned by KEYCARD, the ESP for a particular VPN may be targeted as well.
- TURMOIL sends to HAMMERSTEIN (via TURBINE) the parameters for capturing the ESP for the targeted VPN.
# APEX VolP Phases 

## - VolP Phase 1: Static Tasking of VolP (Spin 16)

- HAMMERCHANT monitors VolP SIP/H. 323 signaling and exfiltrates only targeted VolP RTP sessions to TURMOIL.
- APEX reconstructs and bundles the voice packets into a file, attaches appropriate metadata, and delivers to PRESSUREWAVE.
- This triggers a modified VolP analytic to prepare the VolP for corporate delivery.


## - VolP Phase 2. VolP Call Survey

- HAMMERCHANT monitors VolP SIP/H. 323 signaling and exfiltrates all call signaling metadata to TURMOIL.
- APEX inserts call signaling metadata into an ASDF record and publishes it to the TURMOIL AsdfReporter component for target SIGDEV.


## - VolP Phase 3. Dynamic Targeting of VolP

- HAMMERSTEIN captures/exfils all VolP signaling
- APEX reconstructs/reinjects the signaling to the TURMOIL VolP components.
- TURMOIL VolP extracts call metadata and sends to FASCIA; checks KEYCARD for hits.
- If called/calling party is targeted for active exfil, then TURMOIL sends to HAMMERSTEIN (via TURBINIE) the parameters to capture the targeted RTP session.
- Implementation of VolP Phase 2 and 3 will be driven by mission need.
- Phase 3 leverages all TURMOIL VolP signaling protocol processors to expand beyond SIP and H. 323 (e.g. Skype) without additional development on the implant.
