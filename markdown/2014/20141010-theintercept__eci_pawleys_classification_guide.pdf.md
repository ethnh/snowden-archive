## (U//FOUO) ORIGINAL CLASSIFICATION AUTHORITY:

(TS//SI//REL) ECI PAWLEYS (PAW) protects clandestine HUMINT and computer network access intended to obtain cryptographic information and material. It protects operational details, as well as any equipment, materials, technical information and some SIGINT capabilities gained as a result of such access.

| (U) GENERAL GUIDELINES AND OPERATIONAL DETAILS |  |  |  |  |
| 3. (TS//SI//REL) The fact that NSA has requirements for: <br> - HUMINT acquisition of foreign cryptographic information and material. <br> - acquisition of foreign cryptographic information and material via a Computer Network Exploitation (CNE) operation. | TOP SECRET// COMINT//REL | $1.4(\mathrm{c})$ | 20291123 |  |

| 5. (TS//SI//REL) ECI PAWLEYS protects the following as they are related to CNE operations: <br> (1) The fact that an operation is specifically intended to acquire or enable the acquisition of cryptographic information <br> (2) The success (or lack thereof) in acquiring or enabling the acquisition of the intended cryptographic information <br> (3) The technical details of CNE tools that are designed for a specific target's cryptographic system. <br> (4) Cryptographic information collected by a CNE operation conducted specifically for that purpose. | TOP SECRET// <br> COMINT-ECI PAW// <br> REL | $1.4(\mathrm{c})$ | 20291123 | (TS//SI//REL) PAWLEYS will apply to CNE operations and tools (and resulting cryptographic information) ONLY when the operation or tool is tailored to a specific target's cryptographic system. <br> (U//FOUO) NOFORN or some limited 2nd Party release may be applied. Operational information is extremely sensitive and is only divulged under the strictest of need-to-know rules. |
| 6. (TS//SI//REL) ECI PAWLEYS protects the following as they are related to clandestine HUMINT operations: <br> (1) The material, equipment or information resulting from a PAWLEYS operation and the fact of access. <br> (2) Any analysis or technical capability developed as a result of PAWLEYS information. <br> (3) The location, purpose, time frame, means of access or any other operational detail relating to the planning of or accomplishment of a clandestine cryptographic access. <br> (4) Any identifying information regarding HUMINT assets involved in PAWLEYS operations. | TOP SECRET// <br> COMINT-ECI PAW// <br> REL | $1.4(\mathrm{c})$ | 20291123 | (U//FOUO) "Any analysis or technical capability" would include technical papers, notes, software or other techniques, which could not have been developed without PAWLEYS information. <br> (U//FOUO) NOFORN or some limited 2nd Party release may be applied. Operational information is extremely sensitive and is only divulged under the strictest of need-to-know rules. |
