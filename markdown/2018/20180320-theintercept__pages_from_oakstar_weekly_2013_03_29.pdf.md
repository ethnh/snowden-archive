(TSI/NF) Met with SSG11 and S2F on the MR access. The following topics were discussed:

- Checking to see if the DTG/Port/IP Address could be assessed to validate if it hits against the BITCOIN Targets
- Checking to see if the partner does any user validation
- The relationship between BITCOIN targets and the MONKEYROCKET data
- Additional data that is not found in XKS-central, but can be made available to the customer
- The following files were sent to the customer for analysis:
- Mac_address.csv
- Password_hash_history.csv
- Provider user full.csv
- User_sessions full.csv

As of right now, MONKEYROCKET is offering a sole source for SIGDEV for the BITCOIN Targets. We requested feedback and any mission highlights they have or will have. (SNM)
