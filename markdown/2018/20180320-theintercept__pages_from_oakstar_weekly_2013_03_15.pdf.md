MONKEYROCKET: (U//FOUO) ODD received feedback from S21 that this access is supplying collection on BITCOIN and LIBERTYRESERVE; 2 of the top 3 virtual currencies they're targeting. BitCoin is \#1 priority, so your system is being heavily relied upon for SIGDEV.

## MONKEYROCKET: Day 232

(U) $2013=\underline{1}$ report (they were 1 of 43 sources for the report, but hey, it's the $1^{\text {st }}$ ).
(S//SI//REL) MARINA is transitioning to CLOUDRUNNER and our daily and weekly metrics have hit another error. A new ticket has been created to address this issue on 04March 2013 and updated 11 March 2013. Ticket number: MARINA-9940. (SNM)
(TS//NF) No data on 11 March 2013 and we are working with engineering to pin point the issue.
(TS//NF) SSG11 analysts have found value in the MONKEYROCKET access to help track down senders and receivers of Bitcoins (a decentralized digital currency system, wherein the units are known as Bitcoins or BTC.) (SNM)
(TS//NF) S2F214 is hoping to use the access for their mission of looking at organized crime and cyber targets that utilize online e-currency services to move and launder money. These illicit finance networks provide user access to international monetary systems, while providing a high-degree of anonymity. (SNM)
