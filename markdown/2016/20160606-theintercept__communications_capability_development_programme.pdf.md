## [edit] What is the CCD Programme?

- The Communications Capability Development (CCD) Programme (formerly known as the IMP, see background below) is the Home Office led programme of work to maintain the UK's Lawful Intercept and Communications Data capabilities as technology changes.
- CD and LI are critical tools for the police and others: without the CCD programme, they will face a significant decline in their ability to obtain CD and conduct interception to help detect and prevent serious crime and terrorism.
- The programme must tackle some tough challenges. These are real problems that are not going to go away; they are politically contentious, technically complex, and will require significant business change within law enforcement; the development of the National Crime Agency (NCA) will be crucial here.
- The Government intends to legislate to help maintain CD capabilities - see Mission Policy blog on Queen's Speech 2012 and blog on the Draft CD Bill. This legislation would require UK network operators to collect and retain CD they would not ordinarily retain for their business purposes.
- Some of the elements of CCD's proposed solutions are well understood and tested, but other elements, such as those which will likely be needed to cope with emerging challenges, are necessarily new and need to be developed. So the programme will need to continue to manage the technical risks carefully, eg by piloting and risk reduction activities.


## [edit] Background

Before January 2011 the Programme was known as the Intercept Modernisation Programme (IMP). Early proposals for a CD Database were ruled out in 2009. Subsequently the revised IMP approach focused on
data being stored at UK network operators, which would require new legislation. CCDs approach is a package of measures including legislation but also cooperative relationships with CSPs.

In April 2012 there was extensive media coverage about CCD and legislative plans, including inaccurate speculation that there were plans to enable GCHQ to access any emails on demand - see blog post

# [edit] Official Home Office Key Messages on CCD 

HO published an overview of CD, Q\&As and mythbusters on 14/06/12.
Key points include: "Legislation will not...
* provide the police and others with new powers or capabilities to intercept and read emails and phone calls.

* provide the police and others with unregulated access to all forms of communications data.
* create a single Government database containing the records or the content of emails and phone calls.
* require every provider of every communication service in this country to collect every item of data generated by their services.
* allow Local Authorities greater powers.
* create new powers for the intelligence and security agencies."


## [edit] How is GCHQ helping?

GCHQ is providing significant technical and design support to the CCD programme. This includes:

- We are sharing our technical understanding of the internet and how to exploit it (including large scale collection, processing, analysis and storage) gained through Sigint
- The business change other agencies require is similar to the Internet Age transformation and modernisation already underway within GCHQ, so we are also sharing our experience of this, and our expertise in delivering large technically complex programmes
- NTAC is responsible for coordinating domestic interception on behalf of intercepting agencies, and so is already dealing with the requirements to intercept IP communications, and maintain capability as technology develops.
- Over the last couple of years we have worked with CCD within the current legislative framework to provide a target enrichment service (known as the MILKWHITE Enrichment Service or MES) to help other intercepting agencies identify IP selectors for their targets. This is delivering operational benefit to Security Service and the law enforcement agencies, and is also helping illustrate the business change challenge, but it does not remove the need for legislation.

GCHQ is also, albeit to a much smaller extent than the other agencies, a customer of the CCD programme in that we make use of CD acquired from CSPs to help with our targeting, and we also do some domestic interception in support of our Sigint mission. But, unlike others, we are not dependent on CCD delivering, though we see significant benefits for HMG if CCD is a success.

## [edit] Further Information
The National Security Council discussed the CCD programme in November 2011. The NSC paper explains the challenge and proposed response.

The Queen's Speech 2012 announced the government's intention to introduce a Communications Data Bill, subject to pre-legislative scrutiny of the detailed clauses.

The Draft CD Bill and Explanatory Notes were officially published in a Command Paper on 14 June 2012.
