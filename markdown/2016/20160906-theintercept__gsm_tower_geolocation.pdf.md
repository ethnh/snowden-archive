DYMO Prototype Testing - DYMO is a new prototype development for directed GSM tower geolocation. DYMO uses a combination of RUFIS-bis and WHAMI Fast Image (WFI) to target specific areas of interest and produce GSM tower location data with high quality metadata unique to the tower. RUFIS-bis uses new algorithm to burrow down into co-channel GSM ARFCN ( 200 KHz ) channels, and pull out demodulated data streams unique for each cell-id from downlink channels in GSM networks. The data is then remodulated and correlated using WFI to produce geolocation data. The geolocation results are subsequently labeled with the data from RUFIS, insuring the location data and tower metadata match. The remodulated signal (synthetic geolocation) allows for greater accuracy for higher resolution results. Application is in development in the NMDC/Midas Studies.
