- Taliban HVT's recently changed their communication methods and began using VSATs located throughout Afghanistan. The Village and District Communications Networks (VCN and DCN) are comprised of a combined satellite modem and VOIP solution. Working with VOIP experts across the enterprise, MHS analysts discovered a way to make correlations between the VSATs and known DNR numbers. Subsequent military operations targeting these locations resulted in approximately 30 enemy killed, as well as capturing numerous weapons, IEDs, explosive material, and over 7.5 tons of narcotics.
