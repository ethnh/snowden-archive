# ISUAV Video Descrambling

## Introduction

Analogue video from Israeli UAVs has been intercepted in both clear (i.e. unencrypted) and scrambled (i.e. encrypted) formats. Processing clear video using M2Extra is relatively straightforward, the method being described in Anarchist training Module 4. For scrambled video the capability exists to exploit the content using a combination of image processing tools and scrypts on Mutiny Jaguar.

## Background

Interception of scrambled analogue video signals at Anarchist has a long history, with the earliest examples dating back to 1998.

## The Signal

The appearance of the encrypted signal in the frequency domain is virtually indistinguishable from the clear video signal. A comparison of the Post-D data for an example of clear video, and an encrypted example from a few seconds later (figs 1a \& 1b) show that, apart from a subtle modification to the envelope, the signals appear very similar. The most noticable effect is an increase in energy at lower frequencies, consistent with the detail in the image being smoothed out by the scrambling process.

## Scrambled Imagery

As can be seen by examining an example of a frame of scrambled video (Fig.2) the video frame is unchanged by the scrambling method. In addition to the image seen in clear video there is also two lines of digital information encoded in the teletext area at the top of the screen. This is presumed to be information relating to the scrambling, e.g. a cryptographic 'key' to enable the original image to be reconstructed.

Investigation of the data has determined the method by which the video is scrambled. The method used is a 'cut \& slide' technique whereby each line is cut at a location and the two halves are transmitted in the opposite order. This technique was originally used by Sky TV to protect their analogue transmissions before they switched to digital, the system being known as VideoCrypt.

## Exploiting Scrambled Video Images

Having determined the technique used to scramble the video imagery a number of known attacks are available from open source material. One technique in particular offers a brute force way of reconstructing the image, without requiring any knowledge of the generating algorithim.. This technique, and the source code needed to employ it is freely available on the internet.

The computing power needed to descramble the images in near real time is considerable without the use of dedicated hardware such as a video capture card that can record uncompressed images. It is still possible to descramble individual frames to determine the image content without too much effort.

## Method

The method involves capturing a video frame in bitmap (.BMP) format using M2Extra. The video data should be processed as described in the M2Extra video processing guide. When the quality of the video image is good a snapshot can be made of the data in the Event Processing window. Pause the processing and use the left mouse button to zoom in to the scrambled image to exclude the frame.

From the file menu in the top left hand corner of the Event Processing window select Snap . . . (CTRLS), and choose .BMP as the format.

Select the bitmap image from the file menu, right click on the image and select Save ... The image format can be set by pressing the Format button at the bottom of the window. There are a huge number of different formats to select from. The format required is PPM format (portable pixmap).

In a terminal window at a command line prompt type
antisky -bc input.ppm output.ppm
This will now have descrambled the image using the program antisky. The descrambled image can be viewed using the Image Magick tool and converted to a more convenient format if desired.

The initial results from running antisky with the default settings as above may not produce particularly good results depending on the image being descrambled. This is because there may be part of the non-scrambled frame of the image included in the descrambling which corrupts the results. To improve the descrambling there are two more option which force the program to ignore the left and right hand sides of the image. Using the -I and -r (for left and right) flags and experimenting with different values may produce better results. The descrambled image first obtained with the default settings is shown in Fig. 4, whilst the image obtained with the command
antisky -bc -115 -r3 input.ppm output.ppm
is shown in Fig. 5 and is considerably clearer.
There is no quick way of discovering the optimum settings for Antisky other than stepping through the parameter space of values and selecting the one that gives the best results.

As can be seen from Figs 4 \& 5, for a good quality signal and optimal settings near perfect image construction can be achieved.

## MHS FISINT Successfully Collects Israeli F-16 Heads-Up Display (S//SI//REL)

## 1, Menwith Hill Station (F77)

(S//SI/TK//REL) During the recent unrest in the Gaza Strip in January, Menwith Hill Station FISINT operators collected video for the first time from the cockpit of an Israeli Air Force F-16 fighter jet. The day before, MHS FISINT operators collected video from an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The UAV appeared to still be on the ground, which prompted the site to go back to the area again the next day. As a result, MHS collected the F-16 heads-up display that showed a target on the ground being tracked. MHS worked closely with a GCHQ site in Cyprus for tip-offs.
(S//SI//REL) Reacting to the unrest in the Gaza Strip, MHS conducted ad hoc range surveillance. On 3 January, the site collected the aircraft video from an Israeli F-16 fighter. The 14 -second long video showed an "unbroken line" running through the targeting display, indicating that the target being tracked was on the ground. ${ }^{1}$

## 1. INTRODUCTION

1.1 This report covers analysis of S455N a High Data Rate (HDR) signal emanating from an Israeli UAV. The Signal of Interest (SOI) was first intercepted in April 2009 however, the original recording was too weak for full analysis. This report is based on the analysis of a recording made in April 2010.
1.2 S455N is a complex signal utilising a number of error correction and detection techniques to successfully convey Internet Protocol (IP) data carrying streaming digital video.

## 2. MODULATION

2.1 The SOI employs FSK modulation and is keyed at 9.11MBauds occupying approximately 10 MHz bandwidth. Demodulation of the SOI was attempted using various demodulators including m2Extra however, the resultant bits were poor quality. The SOI was successfully demodulated using an FM demod in Black Magic.
2.2 Data is NR2L and frames consist of 4140 bits with a 44 bit synchronisation pattern 11101011010101001101001101110011011111110000.

## 3. FORWARD ERROR CORRECTION (FEC) AND ERROR DETECTION

3.1 FEC and EDAC are achieved utilising a block interleaver and a two dimensional Turbo Product Code (TPC). The interleaver is a $64 \times 64$ bit block interleaver used to spread the data to improve the performance of the TPC. The TPC is a $(64,57) *(64,57) 2$ dimensional code employing parity with a generating polynomial of:-

$$
g(x)=x^{6}+x^{1}+1
$$

3.2 The FEC can be utilised to correct the data using magyk or removed by applying a t3648s448 to remove the vertical dimension and a t57s7 to remove the horizontal dimension.

![img-13.jpeg](img-13.jpeg)

Fig 3: Depview showing vertical dimension

# 4. RANDOMISER 

4.1 After deinterleaving the data and removing the FEC the frame width should be 3249 (57*57). The frame begins with a 10 bit sync except on every third frame where 10 bits of data are sent. These 10 bits of data raster on a width of 512 and conform to S455E. Removal of the 10 bits of sync/S455E from each frame will result in a frame width of 3239. The remaining data is randomised using a feed through randomiser F15(0,1,15).

## 5. PAYLOAD

5.1 Following removal of the randomiser the data was found to be HDLC. The packets contained IP data carrying Universal Datagram Protocol (UDP) conveying a number of different protocols. The main protocol in use was Real Time Protocol (RTP) and this was being used to carry MPEG 4 streaming video. Analysis of the video revealed multiple video streams from different cameras. The exact video encoding parameters have not been fully resolved and this should be taken in to consideration when viewing any outputted files.

## 7. CONCLUSION

7.1 A number of elements of this SOI need further analysis

- Video - Being analysed by OPC-SPF, GCHQ
- Remaining IP Data - They are a number of protocols in use that need resolving
7.2 This is potentially a significant upgrade to the normal analogue video we see, this new system adds the capability to see a number of video feeds simultaneously. We currently have no collection system capable of processing this signal due to the high data rate and complexity of the underlying data. There are a number of SIGINT collection solutions that would be more than capable of dealing with this signal should there be a requirement to do so.
