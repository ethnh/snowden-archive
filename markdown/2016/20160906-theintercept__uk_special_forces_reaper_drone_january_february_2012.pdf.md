# AFGHANISTAN 

VSAT Geolocation QRC. Efforts between CARBOY and MHS GHOSTHUNTER to support a GCHQ VSAT request on behalf of UK Special Forces resulted in verifiying the location of a specific terminal in the Sangin area, Helmand Province, previously unreported. Within an hour of collection British forces in Afghanistan dispatched an MQ-9 Reaper (Predator-B) to the location provided by MHS. (SMM Notes, 3/12)
