(S//REL) New Tool Combines Multi-INT, Multi-Agency Databases for Complete Target Snapshot FROM:
Menwith Hill Station (MHS - F77)
Run Date: 06/18/2008
(U//FOUO) Here's a new tool that geospatial-metadata analysts will find useful...
(S//REL) A new tool suite was recently developed that takes information sharing to the next level. The Consolidated Operations Research Explorer (CORE) combines databases from seven intelligence agencies ${ }^{1}$ to quickly give analysts a more complete picture of their target. This tool cross-references known communications networks with multiple layers of existing intelligence feeds to provide an efficient analytical environment. Developed by analysts from Menwith Hill Station and the National GeospatialIntelligence Agency, CORE accesses SIGINT, HUMINT and IMINT to give analysts across the enterprise "one-stop shopping" for their intelligence needs. Currently, this powerful and user-friendly tool is available at MHS, NSAW, NSA Georgia and the Aerospace Data Facility in Denver, but could expand to the Extended Enterprise.
(S//REL) Two MHS analysts developed CORE to solve the problems of duplication of effort, loss of legacy knowledge and an incomplete picture of the analytical "battle space." Prior to the implementation of CORE, many of the geospatial metadata analysis functions were done in a text-only format in spreadsheets. CORE, however, takes text-based information and presents it at its pertinent location within the easy-to-operate Google Earth environment. Google Earth is a critical component of the tool suite as it allows access to geospatial-based intelligence from seven intelligence agencies within seconds. Used along with the SIGINT Emitter DiscoveryBase ${ }^{2}$, CORE offers analysts an unparalleled combination of target and signals in a given area.
(S//REL) CORE also includes services from the SEDB Google Earth Knowledge Base (GEKB) and offers indispensable context for evaluation of collection from the SEDB Control Panel and interpretation of analytic results from models built using the SEDB GeoProcessing Toolbox. Furthermore, CORE's portability, use of existing equipment, seamless integration with current systems and lack of cost add to its appeal.

# (U) Operational Success 

(S//SI//REL) CORE has already facilitated some significant mission successes. In less than one minute, MHS analysts used CORE to easily find a VSAT uplink used by
. Furthermore, due to the depth of information, analysts were able to quickly track down the appropriate FORNSAT manager for rapid tasking.
(S//SI//REL) Another mission success was the association of
. in one day by one analyst. This was a great achievement, and saved manpower and other resources since normally this would have been a week-long effort by a group of linguists, combined with an HPCP expert.

## (U) How it works

(S//REL) CORE is extremely user friendly. A PC with PKI-enabled Internet Explorer, Google Earth and an Intelink connection are all that is required. CORE loads from a network link and -- due to the fact that CORE is only a series of links -- it is just 125 kilobytes in size. CORE is currently maintained by one of its creators, who also serves as the Primary Management Officer.
(S//REL) The heart of CORE is the tree structure at the left of the screen shot shown above. Analysts
click on the links they want to appear within the view window. Available links include: Analysis, Technologies, Reporting, Countries, Terrorism, Maps, Raw Imagery and Mobile Switching Centers. These links quickly display the Intelligence Community's latest and best information regarding SIGINT, GEOINT, HUMINT, infrastructure information and finished intelligence products. Data from these sources combines to form layers over the target area. When the layers come together, they show not only what the Intelligence Community knows about the emitters in a given area (signal related information data), but also what the Intelligence Community knows about the installations, organizations, and personnel that use those emitters. The entire picture of a target location unfolds within a matter of seconds.

# (U) Operational use 

(S//SI//REL) CORE is currently used by many geospatial-metadata analysts (GMA) throughout NSA. The entire Iran TOPI ${ }^{3}$ has incorporated it as their standard GMA tool suite. CORE is logically organized on the left side of the screen, a key element to its success. The organization complements the way the bulk of successful GMA analysts carry out their work.
(S//SI//REL) A large measure of redundancy is built into CORE's searches. For example, an analyst could search for Pakistani GHOSTHUNTER ${ }^{4}$ VSAT ellipses two different ways using the following trees: Technologies $>$ Satcom $>$ GHOSTHUNTER; or Countries $>$ Pakistan $>$ Satcom. Additionally, there is a "text" window and search function that quickly highlights the link of interest. Once the ellipses are on the map, infrastructure, personnel, user, and other SIGINT information from seven different agencies are simply a click away.

## (U) Future

(S//SI//REL) It is envisioned that the CORE user group will expand and encompass all GMAs across the NSA enterprise. CORE has been briefed to LTG Keith Alexander and Mr. Bill Crumm on recent trips to MHS. The CORE team also briefed this new capability at the NSA SIGDEV conference. A video of this presentation can be viewed on the web.
