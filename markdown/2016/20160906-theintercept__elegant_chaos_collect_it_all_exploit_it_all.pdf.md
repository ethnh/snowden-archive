# Field Site Responsibilities 

![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)
# For Better Or Worse... 

## Collection access is increasing,

- software modems (ASPHALT/A-PLUS)
- new hardware/software solutions (STORMFORCE modems and DARKQUEST auto-survey)
- new physical capacity (TORUS antennae)


## Processing capabilities are increasing,

- JCE, TINT, XKS Deep Dive

But size of analytic workforce is not!

- more resources = more resource management
# New Collection Posture 

![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)
# ELEGANTCHAOS Goals 

- Goal: perform basic, time-sensitive analysis on all of MHS collection
- Goal: create a prioritized list of signals (case notations) in our viewing arc
- Goal: use this list to automatically drive collection as collection capabilities increase
- Offshoot goal: create a product that analysts and collection managers can use to see into the system
# ELEGANTCHAOS + Cloud 

## The MHS Cloud provides an excellent platform for this project:

- data ingest, normalization, tagging
- access to SIGINT data from various
processors, from sustained mission + survey
- access to a huge body of enrichment data
- processing, storage, and web-hosting
- considering decoupling these parts...

# Analytic Questions (May 2011) 

| Target | Technology |
| :--: | :--: |
| - Dictionary hits | - VPNs |
| - Target Networks | - Twitter, Facebook, VoIP |
| - TNS, TW, CNO | - CNO behavior |
| - PLUS Reports, CRNs, etc. |  |
| Location | Miscellany |
| - IP-based | - Modem Capacity |
| - MAC-based | - Paired Links |
| - Geo-based | - Quantumable |
| - Surge Countries |  |
| - Libya, Egypt, Afghanistan, Syria, Yemen, Ivory Coast, etc. |  |
# Questions \& Scoring 

- Each question is represented by a SQL query applied to one or more QFDs
- QFDs are case notation-based repositories of signal information
- eg, IPs and registries for all case notations
- eg, category hits for all case notations
- eg, GLOBETROTTER geos for all case notations
- All questions are asked once per day across all case notations
- Points are assigned to each question based on current analytic priorities
- Points for any particular question are "active" for a window of time (eg, 1 day, 7 days, 30 days)
- The sum of "active" points for a case notation, across all questions, forms the score
# Interfaces 

## Different interfaces for different customers

- ELEGANTCHAOS GUI
- made for analysts to examine scores and the impact of the different questions
- eventually, control over the algorithms may reside here
- REST interface
- made for programmatic query, precursor to auto tasking
- DRINKYBIRD GUI
- made for collection personnel to determine if resources are available, easy to view what's on cover

# REST: "Auto-tasking"

# Libya Surge 

## PROBLEM

Which of the 1000's of signals surveyed have Libyan / Egyptian / Afghan networks on the VSAT-side?

## SOLUTION

- Pre-run analytics determine "significance"
- Quick identification of 25 'LY' / 11 'EG' / 10 'AF' candidate signals
- Combine other analytics: target hits, pairing, etc.
- (Repeat for next country)
# AMULET STELLAR 

## PROBLEM

Which case notations have traffic on IPs of interest that matches AST fingerprints?

## SOLUTION

- Create IP target set; create whitelist and blacklist of XKS fingerprints
- Use Cloud capabilities to bridge between the set of all SIGINT events with matching fingerprints, and the target set
- Add the scoring question to EC
# Ongoing Work 

- New data feeds (FOGHORN, MATCHMAKER, ROADBED)
- More fields from XKS (HTTP language, NetStrings)
- XKS from MOONPENNY
- Fine tuning of GUI for Link Characterization Analysts
- NetStrings study
- Better use of Cloud resources (Link Direction) (CCDP)
- Detailed study of scoring methodology (math hire)
- Close the auto-tasking loop
- Increase awareness and partnership with similar efforts
- Training
