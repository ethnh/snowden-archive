## LETTER OF PROMULGATION

This Annex implements Section 2.3. and Section 2.6.(b) of Executive Order 12333, Section 372 and Section 374 of Title 10, United States Code, and special Attorney General procedures. It regulates certain COMINT activities of the United States Signals Intelligence System which are directed against radio communications of suspected international narcotics traffickers. SIGINT activities directed against international narcotics traffickers or trafficking activities that are not within the purview of this Annex are regulated by the basic USSID.
(U/ $\boldsymbol{\text { FOLT }}$ This is the initial issue of this USSID SP0018, Annex J (formerly USSID 18, Annex J).
(U/ $\boldsymbol{\text { FOLT }}$ This USSID contains sensitive information that is legally protected from release to any member of the public and is to be used only for official purposes of the National Security Agency and its customers. Users must strictly adhere to all classification and handling restrictions (see (see NSA/CSS Classification Manual 123-2)) when storing hard or soft copies of this USSID or when hyperlinking to this USSID. The SIGINT Policy System Manager will maintain and update this USSID on-line where users may access the most current version from the NSANet. Appropriate USSIDs will also be available on INTELINK, as warranted. Users are responsible for the update and management of this USSID when it is stored locally.
(U/ $\boldsymbol{\text { FOLT }}$ United States SIGINT System (USSS) contractors or consultants assigned to NSA/CSS Headquarters or to other elements of the SIGINT Extended Enterprise are preauthorized for access to USSIDs via NSANet, INTELINK, or in hard-copy formats as needed to perform their jobs. However, for those sensitive USSIDs for which access is passwordcontrolled, all users, to include contractors, must undergo additional security and mission vetting. Non-USSS contractors or consultants working at external facilities are pre-authorized for softcopy access to USSIDs via NSANet or INTELINK, if connectivity to those systems is allowed by the contractor's NSA/CSS sponsor. Where such connectivity is not established, any hard-copy provision of USSIDs must be authorized by the SIGINT Policy System Manager (NSTS: 9633593, STU-III: (443) 479-1442, DSN: 644-7492).
(U/ $\boldsymbol{\text { FOLT }}$ This USSID is not releasable to any Third Party partner. If a shareable version of this USSID is needed (see USSID SP0002, Annex B (formerly USSID 2, Annex B)), please contact the appropriate Country Desk Officer in the Foreign Affairs Directorate.

THE EXECUTIVE AGENT:

1.1. (5)(5)(5) This Annex implements Section 2.3., and Section 2.6.(b) of Executive Order 12333, Section 372, and Section 374 of Title 10, United States Code, and special Attorney General procedures. It regulates certain COMINT activities of the United States SIGINT System (USSS) which are directed against radio communications of suspected international narcotics traffickers. Nothing contained in this Annex affects the basic authority of the USSS to collect and disseminate foreign intelligence regarding aspects of international narcotics trafficking activities, including other than those activities expressly addressed herein. SIGINT activities directed against international narcotics traffickers or trafficking activities that are not within the purview of this Annex are regulated by the basic USSID.
1.2. (U)(F)(1)(1) The provisions of this Annex will be implemented only upon specific instruction from DIRNSA/CHSS or his designee.

d. (S) Wire Communications: Any communicati on carried in whole or part by wire, cable or other like connection furnished or operated by any person engaged as a common carrier in providing or operating such facilities for the transmission of interstate or foreign communications. Wire communications enjoy a reasonable expectation of privacy. The USSS may intentionally intercept communications of a U.S. person under circumstances where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy of such communications, only with prior authorization of the Attorney General, an order of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, or prior consent of the U.S. person. Thus.
