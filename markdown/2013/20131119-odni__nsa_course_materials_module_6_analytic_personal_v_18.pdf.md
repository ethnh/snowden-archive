| (TSI/SI/INF) (HMC Character): In Module 1, we mentioned that in order to gain comprehensive insight into a target's activities, it is often necessary to average multiple authorities and tools. CT targets have maintained an ongoing desire to conduct attacks within the United States. Given the unique U.S.focus of the BR and PR/TT Programs, N\&A is able to fill collection gaps left by our other authorities. |  |  |  |  |  |
| (TSI/SI/INF) To illustrate how these various authorities can complement each other to fill critical gaps, as well as to show how BR and PR/TT fit into the analytic workflow, we'll step through the example of Najibullah Zazi and the New York subway plot. |  |  |  |  |  |

| (TSJ/SI/INF) (HMC Character): After the RAS requests were approved, using the BR and PR/TT modes of CT analysts began running federated metadata queries on the approved identifiers, as we discussed in Module 4. The analyst querying Zazi's Colorado phone number discovered that around the time that Zazi exchanged emails with the the had also contacted phone numbers. Using the guidance that we discussed in Module 4, the analyst determined that Zazi's contacts with these iUul kirs were unique to BR metadata. Based on this uniqueness, the analyst began drafting a report in accordance with the dissemination guide we reviewed in Module 4. Before the report was released, the Chief of $\& 12$ determined that the report met the CT Nexus criteria and approved its release. |  |  |  |  |  | Comment [a5]: Use one of screenshots showing what a cham/query looks like |
| (TSJ/SI/INF) Remember, even "fact of" statements describing what BR- or PR/TT-unique data was discovered are considered "query results" under FI\&C guidelines and must be handled in accordance with the Court Orders. However, once formally disseminated to customers, it no longer requires the protection and is treated as normal \&IGINT analysis, as is the case with the example we have just described. |  |  |  |  |  |  |

Question 3. (TS/QUINF) Correct! If the same information is discovered through another source, neither the BR nor PR/TT rules and requirements apply (TS/QUINF) Incorrect. The correct answer is b) (False). Neither the BR nor PR/TT rules and requirements apply if the same information is discovered through another source.

| FRAME ID: 6090 | (U) Practice Scenario 1 |  |  |  |  |  |
|  | (TSUSUNN) You are a <br> cleared analyst who, through PR/TT metadata analysis of seeds associated |  |  |  |  |  |
|  | with a high value CT target, has identified a PR/TT-unique direct contact - email address |  |  |  |  |  |
| NEXT FRAME ID: 6100 | believed to be used by someone in Yemen. You are not sure whether the identifier warrants further development as |  |  |  |  |  |
|  | a target, but to find out you place <br> in a tasking database to enable content collection from |  |  |  |  |  |
|  | E.O. 12333 sources. This tasking database is widely available to all intelligence analysts in the SIGINT Production |  |  |  |  |  |
|  | Chain. For this reason, you note in the comments field that this identifier was discovered through metadata analysis |  |  |  |  |  |
|  | and is believed to be a direct contact of the high value CT target, but you deliberately avoid identifying the PR/TT |  |  |  |  |  |
|  | metadata as the source of the identifier. Are your actions in compliance with the terms of the PR/TT Orders? |  |  |  |  |  |
| ALT TAG: | (U) Please select the your answer: |  |  |  |  |  |
| GRAPHIC/AV: | a) (TSUSUNN) Yes, because you did not include the reference to PR/TT. |  |  |  |  |  |
|  | b) (TSUSUNN) No, because you failed to mark the source of the identifier as PR/TT metadata. |  |  |  |  |  |
|  | c) (TSUSUNN) Yes, because the results will be governed under E.O. 12333 rules and procedures. |  |  |  |  |  |
|  | d) (TSUSUNN) No, because you have shared a PR/TT-unique query result with a wide audience |  |  |  |  |  |
|  | of intelligence analysts, many of whom do not hold current <br> credentials. |  |  |  |  |  |

(U) (HMC Character): Now let's practice what we have learned using a real-life scenario. Carefully read the scenario and then select the best answer.

# ANSWER: 

a) (TSUSUNN) Incorrect. The correct answer is d). No, because you have shared a PR/TT-unique query result with a wide audience of intelligence analysts, many of whom do not hold current $\square$ credentials.
b) (TSUSUNN) Incorrect. The correct answer is d). No, because you have shared a PR/TT-unique query result with a wide audience of intelligence analysts, many of whom do not hold current $\square$ credentials.
c) (TSUSUNN) Incorrect. The correct answer is d). No, because you have shared a PR/TT-unique query result with a wide audience of intelligence analysts, many of whom do not hold current $\square$ credentials.
d) (TSUSUNN) Correct! The right answer is d). No, because you have shared a PR/TT-unique query result with a wide audience of intelligence analysts, many of whom do not hold current $\square$ credentials.
