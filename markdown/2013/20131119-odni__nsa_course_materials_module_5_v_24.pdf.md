| FRAME ID: 5020 | (U) The Analytical Work Role |  |  |  |  |
|  | (TS/\$1/NF) The Analytical Work Role includes these primary functions: <br> - HMC <br> - Those who conduct intelligence analysis queries <br> - Those who can view and disseminate the results of intelligence analysis queries |  |  |  |  |

| (TS/\$1/NF) (HMC Character): The analytical work role includes three primary functions: Homeland Mission Coordinators (HMC), those who can conduct intelligence analysis queries, and those who can view and disseminate the results of intelligence analysis queries. |  |  |  |  |  |
| (TS/\$1/NF) Homeland Mission Coordinators, or HMCs, review and approve the RAS nominations. The analysts and HMCs work through the RAS approval process together to get the identifiers RAS-approved. |  |  |  |  |  |
| (TS/\$1/NF) Recall from the last module that not all analysts are permitted to conduct contact chaining queries. Those who are permitted to conduct queries of the bulk metadata have been granted. |  |  |  |  |  |

| FRAME ID: 5030 | (U) The Technical Work Role |  |  |  |  |
|  | (TS//SI//NF) The Technical Work Role is made up of two main functions: <br> - Support to Collection and Metadata <br> - Support to Storage, Presentation, and Maintenance |  |  |  |  |

| GRAPHIC/AV: <br> (U) Begin with image of HMC Character and Technical Character sitting at a table, then provide a close up of the Technical Character |  |  |  |  |  |
| (TS//SI//NF) (Technical Character): The work performed by technical personnel in support of the Bulk Metadata Programs assists everyone working in support of these programs to maintain compliance with applicable legal documents and relevant authorities. Within the technical roles, there are two main areas of responsibility: collection and metadata and the storage, presentation, and maintenance of the metadata. |  |  |  |  |  |
| (TS//SI//NF) Some high-level examples of how key organizations support collection and metadata include: <br> - $\square$ to gain access to BR and PR/TT metadata. <br> - $\square$ to go to gain access to BR and PR/TT metadata. <br> - $\square$ to get and standardizational and standardization. <br> - Mission Capabilities (TD) integrates the BR and PR/TT protocol processing software into the larger exploitation systems. |  |  |  |  |  |
| (TS//SI//NF) and Mission Capabilities also support the storage, presentation, and maintenance aspects of the Bulk Metadata Programs, and some high-level examples include: <br> - Mission Capabilities manages the BR and PR/TT repositories, as well as prepares the metadata for the analysts to use. <br> - $\square$ provides reasonable assurance that the data is normalized and presented in a usable format and provides support to intelligence analysts. |  |  |  |  |  |

| FRAME ID: 5040 | (U) Authorization to Touch the Data |  |  |  |  |
| NEXT FRAME ID: 5050 | (U) Analytical and technical personnel have different authorization to touch the metadata due to the nature of their work roles |  |  |  |  |
| BACK FRAME ID: 5030 | (U) Authorization for Analytical Personnel |  |  |  |  |
| ALT TAG: | Perform intelligence analysis (querying the data) |  |  |  |  |
| GRAPHIC/AV: <br> (U) Insert image of HMC Character and Technical Character sitting at a table |  | (U) Authorization |  |  |  |
| (TS//SI//NF) (Technical Character): As we have discussed throughout the course, the sensitivity of the data drives many of the policies and restrictions that control access to the BR and PR/TT bulk metadata. However, because of the different roles and responsibilities of analytical and technical personnel, both have different authorizations to touch the metadata. Recall from Module 1 we defined "touching the data" as any form of data handling that creates an opportunity for a violation of the FISC Orders to occur. These activities may include data acquisition, modifying/preparing the data, querying, viewing results of the queries, and even oversight and compliance functions. |  |  |  |  |  |
| Analytic Personnel Info (audio file name OVSC_1205_MS_5040_A) <br> (TS//SI//NF) (HMC Character): Analytic personnel have authorization to touch the metadata to perform intelligence analysis. Analyst actions, such as querying the metadata for intelligence analysis purposes, must be done in a controlled way via tools designed to limit intelligence analysis access to RASapproved identifiers and to the appropriate number of hops. Using these tools also provides reasonable assurance that these queries are tracked and |  |  |  |  |  |

audited.
Technical Personnel Info (audio file name OVSC_1205_M5_5040_7).
(TS//SI//NF) (Technical Character): Technical personnel create, test, and implement tools to make this data easier for analytic personnel to use, while validating that safeguards appropriately control analysts' access to the bulk metadata. Additionally, technical personnel may access the metadata to perform those processes needed to make the metadata usable for intelligence analysis. These processes may include metadata validation; the defeat of the collection, processing, or analysis of metadata associated with $\square$ identifiers; and the maintenance of records to demonstrate compliance with the terms of the authority.
(TS//SI//NF) In order to do this work effectively, technical personnel are allowed to access the metadata using identifiers that are not RAS-approved. In the case of $\square$ identifiers, technical personnel may use non-RAS-approved identifiers to query the metadata to confirm if the identifier is a $\square$ identifier and thus should not be included for target analysis. They may then share the identifier and the fact that it is a $\square$ identifier with authorized personnel. However, no other information resulting from such queries can be used for intelligence analysis purposes.
(TS//SI//NF) Technical personnel must take great care with their responsibilities because they may be accessing the data through tools that do not have safeguards, such as $\square$ that impose restrictions and minimize the chances of a violation of the FISC Orders. As a result, we need to maintain boundaries between technical and analytical personnel, and be crystal clear as to the circumstances under which the two groups can interact.

| FRAME ID: 5050 | (U) Interaction Between Analytical and Technical Personnel |  |  |  |  |
|  | (U) (Begin with image of analytical and Technical Character sitting at a table, then provide a close up of the Technical Character) |  |  |  |  |
| NEXT FRAME ID: 5060 | (TS//SI//NF) All interactions must be based on RAS-approved identifiers and those results found within the number of hops authorized for intelligence analysis purposes |  |  |  |  |

| GRAPHIC/AV: <br> (U) Insert image of HMC Character and Technical Character sitting at a table |  |  |  |  |  |

(TS//SI//NF) (Technical Character): As we just discussed, analytical and technical personnel have different authorizations to touch this metadata. Because of these different authorizations, we must be careful when the two types of personnel are interacting with regard to this metadata. Specifically, outside of the sharing of identifiers for defeat purposes, technical personnel should only be providing analytical personnel information under certain conditions.
(TS//SI//NF) (HMC Character): Sometimes, when analyzing the results of intelligence analysis queries, one or more of the specific results may seem out of the ordinary. Is it a identifier that was overlooked? Is the identifier misnormalized? Is there something that just seems out of place? Or perhaps there is a particular data field in your results that you don't understand. In such instances, intelligence analysts may require assistance from certain technical personnel responsible for data integrity functions.
(TS//SI//NF) (Technical Character): In these instances, technical personnel may assist authorized intelligence analysts, but any and all assistance must be based on RAS-approved identifiers and those results found within the number of hops authorized for intelligence analysis purposes. Essentially, when providing information to analytical personnel in these circumstances, the technical personnel must abide by the rules for the analytical personnel.
(TS//SI//NF) (Technical Character): In the end, all personnel have a vested interest and shared responsibility in ensuring that only the most accurate intelligence information is reported to customers, while abiding by the policies and requirements in place for this metadata.
