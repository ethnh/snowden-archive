## TS//SI//REL) TAO-enabled collection against the Mexican Office of the President (project FLATLIQUID) has also been a lucrative source of SIGINT. In late May 2010, TAO successfully exploited a key mail server in the Mexican PRESIDENCIA domain within the Mexican Presidential network to gain first-ever access to President Felipe Calderon's public email account. The targeted domain, also used by the Mexican presidential cabinet, contained diplomatic, economic and leadership communications which continue to provide insight into Mexico's political system and internal stability. Collection from FLATLIQUID accesses has provided reportable intelligence for several S2 product lines at both NSA/CSS Texas and Washington as well as SCS Mexico City.
