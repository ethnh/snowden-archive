| FRAME ID: 3030 | (U) What is Reasonable Articulable Suspicion (RAS)? |  |  |  |  |
|  | (U) Reasonable Articulable Suspicion (RAS) Standard <br> (IS/ST/NF) An identifier will meet the Reasonable Articulable Suspicion Standard if based on the factual and practical considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent persons act, there are facts giving rise to a reasonable articulable suspicion that the identifier is associated with one of the specified Foreign Powers. |  |  |  |  |

| GRAPHIC/AV: <br> (U) Display pop-up with the definition of RAS as it is discussed. |  |  |  |  |  |

(TS/ST/NF) (OGC Attorney): The FISC recognizes the potential counterterrorism advantage gained through analysis of the BR and PR/TT bulk metadata; however, because there is a great deal of U.S. person information included in the bulk metadata, the FISC has set strict guidelines on when and how analysts can access the metadata under these authorities. The RAS standard is one of these guidelines which helps to provide reasonable assurance that only legitimate terrorism-related identifiers are used to query the bulk metadata. This standard must be met before queries can be conducted.
(TS/ST/NF) So what is RAS? RAS is a legal standard that describes the measure of proof required to support a decision whether to permit an identifier to be queried from the bulk metadata. The Reasonable Articulable Suspicion standard requires just that-a suspicion that you can explain in a reasonable way. It does not require certainty, but is more concrete than a simple hunch. It may be easiest to think of it in terms of other standards with which you may be familiar.
(TS/ST/NF) Many of you may be familiar with legal standards of proof applicable in other situations. It may be helpful to understand how the RAS standard compares to these other legal standards. For example, a jury in a criminal case will not convict an accused unless the evidence of guilt is "beyond a reasonable doubt. "This is the highest legal standard of proof. A jury in a civil case (such as a personal injury case or a contract dispute) might award a plaintiff money damages if the plaintiff proves the elements of his claim by "a preponderance of the evidence." This standard is lower than "beyond a reasonable doubt." Lower still is the standard of proof required to justify issuance of a search warrant - "probable cause" - whether that search warrant is for the suspect's home or the content of the suspect's communications. The RAS standard falls below "probable cause."
# TOP-SECRET/SE/NOFORN- 

(IS/SS/INF) The FISC has determined that this lower standard of proof is reasonable for the querying of metadata because communications metadata does not carry with it the same privacy protections as communications content. The RAS standard falls below "probable cause" but above a mere hunch or guess.

(TS/@I/NF) (HMC Character): From an Analysis and Production standpoint, let's look at RAS in the context of the analyst level of effort required to utilize BR and PR/TT and other SIGINT authorities. As the illustration shows, the level of effort required by an analyst to establish RAS would normally be considered less than that required for FBI CT FISA or FAA 704/705b, but it is more than what is needed to utilize E.O. 12333, for example.

(TG/GH/NF) (OGC Attorney): The FISC states that the RAS decision is based on considerations of "reasonable and prudent persons." This does not, however, mean that anyone can approve an identifier for RAS. There are a select number of people within NSA who have been given the authority to approve identifiers for querying under these two authorities. Those individuals are called Homeland Mission Coordinators or HMCs.
(FG/GH/NF) (HMC Character): As was just mentioned, RAS determinations are typically made by specially trained personnel in the Office of Counterterrorism and its Extended Enterprise; these individuals are titled Homeland Mission Coordinators, typically abbreviated as HMCs. These individuals, like me, have been given special training on how to apply the RAS standard and how to apply it consistently. HMCs are specially trained individuals who have extensive experience working with this target set and who have extensive experience working with these authorities. The HMCs can take a RAS nomination, review the facts, and make a determination as to whether or not that particular identifier meets the RAS standard.
(FG/GH/NF) (HMC Character): According to the BR and PR/TT Orders, in addition to the HMCs, the Chief and Deputy Chief of the Counterterrorism Homeland Security Analysis Center are authorized to make a RAS determination; although, it is generally the HMCs who make the RAS determinations. To reemphasize, no one else is authorized to make RAS determinations according to the Orders.

| :--: | :--: |
| (TSI/SII/INF) (HMC Character): There are certain identifiers that require an extra RAS review/approval step. As you might imagine, those are the identifiers that are reasonably believed to be used by U.S. persons. Why does this matter? It matters because the U.S. Government is forbidden from regarding a U.S. person as associated with a Foreign Power solely because he or she is exercising his or her First Amendment rights. |  |
| (TSI/SII/INF)-(OGC Attorney): That's right. Any identifier believed to be used by a U.S. person must be forwarded to the OGC by a Homeland Mission Coordinator following his or her approval. An OGC attorney will review the RAS nomination, as well as the RAS decision made by the Homeland Mission Coordinator, and make a determination as to whether or not NSA is targeting that individual based solely on activities that are protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution. If there is any indication that the RAS is based solely on information or evidence protected somehow by the First Amendment, OGC will require additional information to support the RAS nomination. |  |
| (TSI/SII/INF) (HMC Character): If you are an analyst, should you abandon a RAS nomination if there is a potential First Amendment concern? Absolutely not. The presence of First Amendment evidence does not invalidate a RAS, it just cannot be the sole basis for a nomination. The OGC review is really transparent to the analyst, though it is a part of the process that you should be aware of. |  |

| FRAME ID: 3070 | (U) What sources of information can be used to justify RAS? |  |  |  |  |
|  | (TS//SI//NF) FISA Orders |  |  | (TS//SI//NF) IC and Public Sector |  |
| NEXT FRAME ID: 3080 | - Existing FISA Orders |  |  | - Federal Bureau of Investigation documents |  |

|  | - SIGDEV Work |  |  | - Public records available on the internet, newspapers, or other public resources |  |
|  | - Other transcripts |  |  |  |  |

[TS//SI//NF) (HMC Character): So now let's look at the type of evidence that can be used to justify RAS. NSA can use any information that is lawfully in our possession. A published SIGINT report describing the results of electronic surveillance of a target might be more reliable than say pocket litter found during a detainee's interrogation -- but NSA can rely on any lawfully held evidence. The HMCs are responsible for assessing the quality and reliability of the evidence.
(TS//SI//NF) (OGC Attorney): Sources that are often used to justify a RAS nomination include, but are not limited to:

- Existing FISA Orders
- SIGINT reports
- FISA surveillance data derived from other authorized targets
- SIGINT traffic, as long as the submitting analyst has performed a Reporting Source Validation Check
- SIGDEV work (with verified sources), and
- Other transcripts
(TS//SI//NF) (OGC Attorney): If an analyst/requestor uses unpublished query results in a RAS justification and they classify the material appropriately as then that information will only be visible to those users with $\square$ credentials, as confirmed via
# -TOP-SECRET//SI//NQFQRN- 

(TS//SI//NF) (OGC Attorney): The following IC and public sector (open source) sources are also examples of sources that are frequently used:

- Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) documents
- Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) documents
- The National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) documents
- Documents from other U.S. Government Organizations
- Foreign Partner nations, and
- Public records available on the internet, newspapers, or other public resources.

(TS//SI//NF) (HMC Character): Remember from earlier in this module, we introduced the RAS process as a simple equation: identifier + link to Foreign Powers = RAS. Now you may be wondering how an identifier is nominated for RAS. NSA must demonstrate and document that every member used to query the bulk metadata meets the RAS standard PRIOR to querying the BR and PR/TT bulk metadata repositories. NSA created the RAS identifier management tool, to streamline the adjudication of the RAS nomination statements and documentation of RAS determinations.
(TS//SI//NF) (HMC Character): Typically, an intelligence analyst will gather the necessary information and draft the nomination statement in IRONMAN articulating the RAS equation. An HMC, also using the HMC, will review the nomination statement and approve or disapprove the request. If the nomination statement is for a U.S. person, the HMC will be able to find includes functionality that allows the HMCs to forward such requests to OGC for the required First Amendment review. In either case, if the RAS nomination is approved, the identifier is now authorized for querying.
(TS//SI//NF) (OGC Attorney): Through NSA documents all RAS-approved identifieri as well as the rationale used to gain RAS approval. IRONMAN provides the ability to use the HMC, and the HMC is therefore the authoritative source for the list of RAS-approved identifiers, and the HMC is therefore the authoritative source for the list of the HMC. (TS//SI//NF) (OGC Attorney): It is important to remember that copies of the documents, such as court orders or reports, are required as part of the nomination process. The paper trail should enable an auditor from Department of Justice (DOJ) to clearly evaluate all of the evidence presented to support a RAS decision.
(TS/\SI/NF) (OGC Attorney): NSA has overseers, specifically the DOJ National Security Division attorneys, who examine the factual support for our RAS decision process. They take a look at any notes that the HMCs or someone within the NSA OGC may have included, and they decide whether or not we have properly applied the RAS standard to all of the identifiers that are used to query the bulk metadata. So it is critical that we take great care throughout the process, gathering and presenting the evidence and applying the RAS standard in a consistent manner across all identifier nominations. also provides metrics and other information to facilitate this oversight review and report generation for the DOJ and the FISC.
(TS/\SI/NF) (OGC Attorney) The Court recognizes that occasionally, NSA may have information suggesting that a target may have used a particular identifier only for a limited time. In such cases, an HMC can determine that the RAS standard is met for the specific timeframe that the identifier was believed to be used by the target. Such instances are considered Time Bounded and are uniquely dealt with in $\square$ Analysts encountering targets under these circumstances should consult with an HMC on how to proceed.

(TS/JSI/NF) (HMC Character): RAS approvals have sunset or expiration dates which analysts must comply with. Currently a RAS approval on a foreign identifier, per the FISC, is legally valid for one year. However, NSA CT has taken a conservative approach and implemented guidance that mandates RAS review and re-approval every 180 days. Likewise, a RAS approval for an identifier believed to be used by a U.S. person has a legal lifespan of 180 days per the FISC, but NSA CT has implemented guidance requiring review and re-approval every 90 days. It is the analyst's responsibility to monitor the sunset dates and take appropriate actions before the RAS nomination expires.
(TS/JSI/NF) (HMC Character): Any identifier can be resubmitted for revalidation at any time. Revalidations require proof of the same categories of information that was required for the original request. Revalidations should try to validate that the original evidence is still true by presenting any new documentation to demonstrate that the identifier is still associated with the Foreign Powers named in the Orders. It is up to the HMCs to make an informed revalidation, based on the totality of the evidence. If you are uncertain of your evidence, submit the nomination anyway and work with the HMCs through the process.
