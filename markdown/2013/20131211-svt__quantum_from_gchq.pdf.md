In order to deploy these stains at scale across machines used by the extremist community in it was decided to target machines where the users visited extremist web forums. QUANTUM was the technique used to deliver the stains to each target machine. QUANTUM is CNE's mechanism that leverages GCHQ's huge passive SIGINT accesses to deliver CNE payloads to targets. As this is a very new approach to tackling a tough target it took 12 months for policy, collection, processing and CNE issues to be resolved, but after a lot of hard work by some committed individuals across Benhall, Bude and SOUNDER successful implementation of staining at scale was achieved.
