# TOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN//MR <br> Targeting Rationale (TAR) 

(C//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) The basic premise of this process is to memorialize why you the analyst have requested targeting. This rationale will be provided to our external FISA Amendment Act (FAA) overseers, the Department of Justice and Office of the Director of National Intelligence, for all FAA targeting.
(S//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) While we do want to provide our FAA overseers with the information they need, we DO NOT want to give them any extraneous information. Please follow these instructions carefully to place a "Targeting Rationale" in the Target Information Comments field in UTT and the Selector Comments field in Octave (Note: There are additional instructions below concerning issues with Octave.). This rationale can be no longer than one short sentence. Please see the screen captures below for proper placement.
(U//FOUO) The TAR must be in the following format: ///TAR: Targeting Rationale (TAR) sentence. $/ / /$ (Note: The "TAR." and leading and trailing triple slashes are critical.)
(U//FOUO) Targeting Requests will be sent back to draft when the TAR is not present or does not meet the below criteria. Please contact your FAA Product Line Lead for help as needed.
(S//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) The essential elements of information needed in the targeting rationale are: "User" of the selector, link between the user and the foreign intelligence purpose, and the foreign intelligence purpose. Avoid the use of acronyms when possible, when used they must be expanded.
(C//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Your rationale MUST NOT contain any additional information including: probable cause-like information (i.e. proof of your analytic judgment), how you came to your analytic conclusions, any RAGTIME information, classification marking, or selector information.
(TS//SI/NF) Below are some actual examples (please use the term "User" or "Selector" not your target's name). Analysts should consult their FAA Product Line Lead for questions concerning TAR construction.
