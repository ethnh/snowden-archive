(U) Fourth Amendment Protections
(U) Balancing Foreign Intelligence Need and Privacy Interest
1.1. (U) The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution protects all U.S. persons anywhere in the world and all persons within the United States from unreasonable searches and seizures by any person or agency acting on behalf of the U.S. Government. The Supreme Court has ruled that the interception of electronic communicatio ns is a search and seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. It is therefore mandatory that signals intelligence (SIGINT) operations be conducted pursuant to procedures which meet the reasonableness requirements of the Fourth Amendment.
1.2. (U) In determining whether United States SIGINT System (USSS) operations are "reasonable," it is necessary to balance the U.S. Government's need for foreign intelligence information and the privacy interests of persons protected by the Fourth Amendment. Striking that balance has consumed much time and effort by all branches of the United States Government. The results of that effort are reflected in the references listed in Section 2 below. Together, these references require the minimization of U.S. person information collected, processed, retained or disseminated by the USSS. The purpose of this document
is to implement these minimization requirements.
1.3. (U) Several themes run throughout this USSID. The most important is that intelligence operations and the protection of constitutional rights are not incompatible. It is not necessary to deny legitimate foreign intelligence collection or suppress legitimate foreign intelligence information to protect the Fourth Amendment rights of U.S. persons.
(U) Minimization of U.S. Person Information
(U) Oversight Functions
1.4. (U) These minimization procedures implement the constitutional principle of "reasonableness" by giving different categories of individuals and entities different levels of protection. These levels range from the stringent protection accorded U.S. citizens and permanent resident aliens in the United States to provisions relating to foreign diplomats in the U.S. These differences reflect yet another main theme of these procedures, that is, that the focus of all foreign intelligence operations is on foreign entities and persons.
(U) Nothing in these procedures shall restrict the performance of lawful compliance or oversight functions over the USSS.

## SECTION 3 - (U) POLICY

(U) Policy and the USSS Foreign

3.1. (U) The policy of the USSS is to TARGET or COLLECT only FOREIGN COMMUNICATIONS.* The USSS will not intentionally COLLECT
Communications communication and communication systems in the U.S. except as set forth in this USSENES and U.S. except as set forth in this USSENES.

* (U) Capitalized words in Sections 3 through 9 are defined terms in Section 9.


# SECTION 4 - (U) COLLECTION 

(U) Collection
4.1. (S/ST/REF) Communications which are known to be to, from or about a U.S. PERSON
intertionally intercepted, or selected through the use of a SELECTION TERM, except in the following instances:
a. (U//F6L/6) With the approval of the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court either under the conditions outlined in Annex A of this USSENES or as permitted by other FISA authorities.
b. (U) With the approval of the Attorney General of the United States, if:
(1) (U) The COLLECTION is directed against the following:
(a) (U//F6L/6) Communications to or from U.S. PERSONS outside the UNITED STATES if such persons have been approved for targeting in accordance with the terms of FISA (e.g., the targeted U.S. PERSON is the subject of an order or authorization issued pursuant to Sections 105, 703, 704, or 705(b) of FISA), or
(b) (S/ST/REF) International communications to, from,
(c) (U//F6L/6) Communications which are not to or from but merely about U.S. PERSONS (wherever located).
(2) (U) The person is an AGENT OF A FOREIGN POWER, and
(3) (U) The purpose of the COLLECTION is to acquire significant FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE information.
c. (U//F6L/6) With the approval of the Director, National Security Agency/Chief, Central Security Service (DIRNSA/CHCSS), so long as the COLLECTION need not be approved by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court or the Attorney General, and

authorize the COLLECTION of information to, from, or about a U.S. PERSON who is outside the UNITED STATES when securing the prior approval of the Attorney General is not practical because:
(a) (U) The time required to obtain such approval would result in the loss of significant FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE and would cause substantial harm to the national security.
(b) (U) A person's life or physical safety is reasonably believed to be in immediate danger.
(c) (U) The physical security of a defense installation or government property is reasonably believed to be in immediate danger.
(2) (U/PGIDD In those cases where the DIRNSA/CHCSS authorizes emergency COLLECTION, except for actions taken under paragraph d.(1)(b) above, DIRNSA/CHCSS shall find that there is probable cause that the TARGET meets one of the following criteria:
(a) (U) A person who, for or on behalf of a FOREIGN POWER, is engaged in clandestine intelligence activities (including covert activities intended to affect the political or governmental process), sabotage, or INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST activities, or activities in preparation for INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST activities; or who conspires with, or knowingly aids and
"electronic surveillance" encompasses 1) the acquisition by an electronic, mechanical, or other surveillance device the contents of any wire or radio communications sent by or intended to be received by a particular, known, United States person if the contents are acquired by intentionally targeting the U.S. person under circumstances in which a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy and a warrant would be required for law enforcement purposes, absent the U.S. person's express or implied consent; 2) the acquisition by electronic, mechanical, or other surveillance device of the contents of any wire communication to or from a person in the United States, without the consent of any party thereto, if such acquisition occurs in the United States, but does not include those communications of computer trespassers that would be permissible under section 2511(2)(i) of title 18 of the United States Code; 3) the intentional acquisition by an electronic, mechanical, or other surveillance device of the contents of any radio communication, under circumstances in which a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy and a warrant would be required if the acquisition were undertaken for law enforcement purposes, and if both the sender and all intended recipients are located inside the United States; or 4) the installation or use of an electronic, mechanical, or other surveillance device in the United States for monitoring to acquire information, other than from a wire or radio communication, under circumstances in which a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy and a warrant would be required if the acquisition were undertaken for law enforcement purposes.
(0) (U) A person who is an officer or employee of a FOREIGN POWER.
(c) (U) A person unlawfully acting for, or pursuant to the direction of, a FOREIGN POWER. The mere fact that a person's activities may benefit or further the aims of a FOREIGN POWER is not enough to bring that person under this subsection, absent evidence that the person is taking direction from, or acting in knowing concert with, the FOREIGN POWER.
(d) (U) A CORPORATION or other entity that is owned or controlled directly or indirectly by a FOREIGN POWER.
(e) (U) A person in contact with, or acting in collaboration with, an intelligence or security service of a foreign power for the purpose of providing access to information or material classified by the United States to which such person has access.
(3) (U) In all cases where emergency collection is authorized, the following steps shall be taken:
(a) (U//F01@) The General Counsel will be notified immediately that the COLLECTION has started.
(b) (U//F0t@) The General Counsel will initiate immediate efforts to obtain Attorney General approval to continue the collection. If Attorney General approval is not obtained within 72 hours, the COLLECTION will be terminated. If the Attorney General approves the COLLECTION, it may continue for the period specified in the approval.
e. (U//F0t@) Annual reports to the Attorney General are required for COLLECTION conducted under paragraphs 4.1.c.(3) and (4). Responsible analytic offices will provide such reports through the Signals Intelligence Director and the General Counsel (GC) to the DIRNSA/CHCSS for transmittal to the Attorney General by 31 January of each year.

(U) Incidental Acquisition of U.S. Person Information
(U) Nonresident Alien Targets
4.3. (U) Information to, from or about U.S. PERSONS acquired incidentally as a result of COLLECTION directed against appropriate FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE TARGETS may be retained and processed in accordance with Section 5 and Section 6 of this USSID.
4.4. (S-ST-RET) Nonresident Alien TARGETS Entering the UNITED STATES.
a. (S-ST-RET) If the communications of a nonresident alien located abroad are being TARGETED and the USSS learns that the individual has entered the UNITED STATES, COLLECTION may continue for a period of 72 hours provided that continued COLLECTION is otherwise permitted by FISA, 2 the DIRNSA/CHCSS is advised immediately, and:
(1) Immediate efforts are initiated to obtain Attorney General approval, or
(2) A determination is made within the 72 hour period that the
b. (U) If Attorney General approval is obtained, the COLLECTION may

2 (S-ST-RET) There is no 72 hour grace period for collection that has been authorized pursuant to Sections 702, 703, 704, or 705(b) of FISA. Collection under Sections 702, 703, 704, or 705(b) of FISA must be terminated as soon as the USSS learns the target has entered the United States. Similarly, DIRNSA may not authorize use of a collection technique while the target is located inside the United States if use of the collection technique would qualify as "electronic surveillance" under FISA (see Footnote 1).

# SECTION 5- (U) PROCESSING 

(U) Selection Terms 5.1. (1) Use of Selection Terms During Processing. When a SELECTION TERM is intended to INTERCEPT a communication on the basis of the content of the communication, or because a communication is enciphered, rather than on the basis of the identity of the COMMUNICANT or the fact that the communication mentions a particular individual, the following rules apply:
a. (1) No SELECTION TERM that is reasonably likely to result in the INTERCEPTION of communications to or from a U.S. PERSON (wherever located). (b)(1)
may be used unless there is reason to believe that FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE will be obtained by use of such SELECTION TERM.
b. (U/PRIDO) No SELECTION TERM that has resulted in the INTERCEPTION of a significant number of communications to or from such persons or entities may be used unless there is reason to believe that FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE will be obtained.
c. (U/PRIDO) SELECTION TERMS that have resulted or are reasonably likely to result in the INTERCEPTION of communications to or from such persons or entities shall be designed to defeat, to the greatest extent practicable under the circumstances, the INTERCEPTION of those communications which do not contain FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE.
5.2. (U/PRIDO) Annual Review by the Signals Intelligence Director:
a. (U/PRIDO) All SELECTION TERMS that are reasonably likely to result in the INTERCEPTION of communications to or from a U.S. PERSON or terms that have resulted in the INTERCEPTION of a significant number of such communications shall be reviewed annually by the Signals Intelligence Director or a designee.
(b. (U/ $\boldsymbol{\text { ( }}$ (1)) The purpose of the review shall be to determine whether there is reason to believe that FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE will be obtained, or will continue to be obtained, by the use of these SELECTION TERMS.
c. (U/ $\boldsymbol{\text { ( }}(\boldsymbol{\Theta})$ A copy of the results of the review will be provided to the Inspector General (IG) and the GC.
(U) Intercepted Material
5.3. (U) Forwarding of Intercepted Material. FOREIGN COMMUNICATIONS collected by the USSS may be forwarded as intercepted to NSA, intermediate processing facilities, and collaborating centers.
5.4. (U) Non-foreign Communications.
a. (U) Communications between persons in the UNITED STATES. Private communications solely between persons in the UNITED STATES inadvertently intercepted during the COLLECTION of FOREIGN COMMUNICATIONS will be promptly destroyed unless the Attorney General determines that the contents indicate a threat of death or serious bodily harm to any person.
b. (U) Communications between U.S. PERSONS. Communications solely between U.S. PERSONS will be treated as follows:
(1) (U) Communications solely between U.S. PERSONS inadvertently intercepted during the COLLECTION of FOREIGN COMMUNICATIONS will be destroyed upon recognition, if technically possible, except as provided in paragraph 5.4.d. below.
(2) (U) Notwithstanding the preceding provision, cryptologic data (e.g., signal and encipherment information) and technical communications data (e.g., circuit usage) may be extracted and retained from those communications if necessary to:
(a) (U) Establish or maintain intercept, or
(b) (U) Minimize unwanted intercept, or
(c) (U) Support cryptologic operations related to FOREIGN COMMUNICATIONS.
c. (U) Communications Involving an Officer or Emplo yee of the U.S. Government. Communications to or from any officer or employee of
the U.S. Government, or any state or local government, will not be intentionally intercepted. Inadvertent INTERCEPTIONS of such communications (including those between foreign TARGETS and U.S. officials) will be treated as indicated in paragraphs 5.4.a. and b., above.
d. (U) Exceptions: Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 5.4.b. and c., the DIRNSA/CHCSS may waive the destruction requirement for international communicat ions containing, inter alia, the following types of information:
(1) Significant FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE, or
(2) Evidence of a crime or threat of death or serious bodily harm to any person, or
(3) Anomalies that reveal a potential vulnerability to U.S. communications security. Communications for which the Attorney General or DIRNSA/CHCSS's waiver is sought should be forwarded to NSA/CSS, Attn: Signals Intelligence Directorate Office of Oversight \& Compliance (SV).
(U) Radio Communications

### 5.5. (U) Radio Communications with a Terminal in the UNITED STATES.

# (U) United States 9.18. (U) UNITED STATES PERSON: 

Person
a. (U) A citizen of the UNITED STATES,
b. (U) An alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the UNITED STATES,
c. (U) Unincorporated groups and associations a substantial number of the members of which constitute a. or b. above, or
d. (U) CORPORATIONS incorporated in the UNITED STATES, including U.S. flag nongovernmental aircraft or vessels, but not including those entities which are openly acknowledged by a foreign government or governments to be directed and controlled by them.
e. (U) The following guidelines apply in determining whether a person is a U.S. PERSON:
(1) (U) A person known to be currently in the United States will be treated as a U.S. PERSON unless that person is reasonably identified as an alien who has not been admitted for permanent residence or if the nature of the person's communications or other indicia in the contents or circumstances of such communications give rise to a reasonable belief that such person is not a U.S. PERSON.
(2) (U) A person known to be currently outside the UNITED STATES, or whose location is not known, will not be treated as a U.S. PERSON unless such person is reasonably identified as such or the nature of the person's communications or other indicia in the contents or circumstances of such communications give rise to a reasonable belief that such person is a U.S. PERSON.
(3) (U) A person known to be an alien admitted for permanent residence may be assumed to have lost status as a U.S. PERSON if the person leaves the UNITED STATES and it is known that the person is not in compliance with the administrative formalities provided by law (8 U.S.C. Section 1203) that enable such persons to reenter the UNITED STATES without regard to the provisions of law that would otherwise restrict an alien's entry into the UNITED STATES. The failure to follow the statutory procedures provides a reasonable basis to conclude that such alien has abandoned any intention of maintaining status as a permanent resident alien.
(4) (U) An unincorporated association whose headquarters are located outside the UNITED STATES may be presumed not to be a U.S. PERSON unless the USSS has information indicating that a substantial number of members are citizens of the UNITED STATES or aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence.
(5) (U) CORPORATIONS have the nationality of the nation/state in which they are incorporated. CORPORATIONS formed under U.S. federal or state law are thus U.S. persons, even if the corporate stock is foreign-owned. The only exception set forth above is CORPORATIONS which are openly acknowledged to be directed and controlled by foreign governments. Conversely, CORPORATIONS incorporated in foreign countries are not U.S. PERSONS even if that CORPORATION is a subsidiary of a U.S. CORPORATION.
(6) (U) Nongovernmental ships and aircraft are legal entities and have the nationality of the country in which they are registered. Ships and aircraft fly the flag and are subject to the law of their place of registration.

## APPENDIX 1 - (U) STANDARD MINIMIZATION PROCEDURES FOR ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE CONDUCTED BY THE NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY (NSA)

## UNITED STATES

FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SURVEILLANCE COURT
WASHINGTON, D.C.

## STANDARD MINIMIZATION

## PROCEDURES FOR ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE

## CONDUCTED BY THE NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY (NSA)

Pursuant to Section 101(h) of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (hereinafter "the Act"), the following procedures have been adopted by the Attorney General and shall be followed by the NSA in implementing this electronic surveillance: (U)
# SECTION 1 - APPLICABILITY AND SCOPE (U) 

These procedures apply to the acquisition, retention, use, and dissemination of non-publicly available information concerning unconsenting United States persons that is collected in the course of electronic surveillance as ordered by the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court under Section 102(b) or authorized by Attorney General Certification under Section 102(a) of the Act. These procedures also apply to non-United States persons where specifically indicated. (U)

## SECTION 2 - DEFINITIONS (U)

In addition to the definitions in Section 101 of the Act, the following definitions shall apply to these procedures:
(a) Acquisition means the collection by NSA through electronic means of a nonpublic communication to which it is not an intended party. (U)
(b) Communications concerning a United States person include all communications in which a United States person is discussed or mentioned, except where such communications reveal only publicly available information about the person. (U)
(c) Communications of a United States person include all communications to which a United States person is a party. (U)
(d) Consent is the agreement by a person or organization to permit the NSA to take particular actions that affect the person or organization. To be effective, consent must be given by the affected person or organization with sufficient knowledge to understand the action that may be taken and the possible consequences of that action. Consent by an organization shall be deemed valid if given on behalf of the organization by an official or governing body determined by the General Counsel, NSA, to have actual or apparent authority to make such an agreement. (U)
(e) Foreign communication means a communication that has at least one communicant outside of the United States, or that is entirely among:
(1) foreign powers;
(2) officers and employees of foreign powers; or
(3) a foreign power and officers or employees of a foreign power.

All other communications are domestic communications. (S-400)
(f) Identification of a United States person means the name, unique title, address, or other personal identifier of a United States person in the context of activities conducted by that person or activities conducted by others that are related to that person. A reference to a product by brand name, or manufacturer's name or the use of a name in a descriptive sense, e.g., "Monroe Doctrine," is not an identification of a United States person. (S-400)
(g) Processed or processing means any step necessary to convert a communication into an intelligible form intended for human inspection. (U)
(h) Publicly available information means information that a member of the public could obtain on request, by research in public sources, or by casual observation. (U)
(i) Technical data base means information retained for cryptanalytic, traffic analytic, or signal exploitation purposes. (5) (5)

# DOCID: 4086222 

(j) United States person means a United States person as defined in the Act. The following guidelines apply in determining whether a person whose status is unknown is a United States person: (U)
(1) A person known to be currently in the United States will be treated as a United States person unless positively identified as an alien who has not been admitted for permanent residence, or unless the nature or circumstances of the person's communications give rise to a reasonable belief that such person is not a United States person. (U)
(2) A person known to be currently outside the United States, or whose location is unknown, will not be treated as a United States person unless such person can be positively identified as such, or the nature or circumstances of the person's communications give rise to a reasonable belief that such person is a United States person. (U)
(3) A person known to be an alien admitted for permanent residence loses status as a United States person if the person leaves the United States and is not in complianc e with Title 8, United States Code, Section 1203 enabling re-entry into the United States. Failure to follow the statutory procedures provides a reasonable basis to conclude that the alien has abandoned any intention of maintaining his status as a permanent resident alien. (U)
(4) An unincorporated association whose headquarters or primary office is located outside the United States is presumed not to be a United States person unless there is information indicating that a substantial number of its members are citizens of the United States or aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence. (U)

## SECTION 3 - ACQUISITION AND PROCESSING - GENERAL (U)

(a) Acquisition (U)

The acquisition of information by electronic surveillance shall be made in accordance with the certification of the Attorney General or the court order authorizing such surveillance and conducted in a manner designed, to the greatest extent reasonably feasible, to minimize the acquisition of information not relevant to the authorized purpose of the surveillance. (5) (5)

## (b) Verification (U)

At the initiation of the electronic surveillance, the NSA or the Federal Bureau of Investigation, if providing operational support, shall verify that the communication lines or telephone numbers being targeted are the lines or numbers of the target authorized by court order or Attorney General certification. Thereafter, collection personnel will monitor the acquisition of raw data at regular intervals to verify that the surveillance is not avoidably acquiring communications outside the authorized scope of the surveillance or information concerning United States persons not related to the purpose of the surveillance. (5) (5)

## (c) Monitoring, Recording, and Processing (U)
(1) Electronic surveillance of the target may be monitored contemporaneously, recorded automatically, or both. (U)
(2) Personnel who monitor the electronic surveillance shall exercise reasonable judgement in determining whether particular information acquired must be minimized and shall destroy inadvertently acquired communications of or concerning a United States person at the earliest practicable point in the processing cycle at which such communication can be identified either as clearly not relevant to the authorized purpose of the surveillance (i.e., the communication does not contain foreign intelligence information) or as containing evidence of a crime which may be disseminated under these procedures. $\boldsymbol{\Theta} \boldsymbol{\Theta} \boldsymbol{\Theta} \boldsymbol{\Theta} \boldsymbol{\Theta}$
(3) Communications of or concerning United States persons that may be related to the authorized purpose of the surveillance may be forwarded to analytic personnel responsible for producing intelligence information from the collected data.

Communications and other information, including that reduced to graphic or "hard copy" form such as shall be reviewed for retention in accordance with the standards set forth in these procedures. Communications and other information, in any form, that do not meet
such retention standards and that are known to contain communications of or concerning United States persons shall be promptly destroyed. (5) (5)

# (f) Non-pertinent Communications (U) 

(1) Communications determined to fall within established categories of non-pertinent communications, such as those set forth in subparagraph (6) of this section, should not be retained unless they contain information that may be disseminated under Sections 5, 6, or 7 below. (U)
(2) Monitors may listen to all communications, including those that initially appear to fall within established categories until they can reasonably determine that the communication cannot be disseminated under Sections 5,6 , or 7 below. (5) (5)

(3) Communications of United States persons will be analyzed to establish categories of communications that are not pertinent to the authorized purpose of the surveillance. (U)
(4) These categories should be established after a reasonable period of monitoring the communications of the targets. (U)
(5) Information that appears to be foreign intelligence may be retained even if it is acquired as a part of a communication falling within a category that is generally non-pertinent. (5) (5)

(6) Categories of non-pertinent communications which may be applied in these surveillance include:
(A) Calls to and from United States Government officials;
(B) Calls to and from children;
(C) Calls to and from students for information to aid them in academic endeavors;

(U) The forms set forth in this Annex have been approved by the National Security Agency's Office of General Counsel (NSA OGC) to obtain and record the express consent of a U.S. person for elements of the United States SIGINT System (USSS) to collect and disseminate communications of or concerning that person for foreign intelligence purposes, to include but not limited to force protection, hostage recovery, and other like purposes.

H1.2. (U/FOtO) Forms 1 and 2 can be used to obtain and record consent to collect and disseminate a U.S. person's communications as well as references to the U.S. person in communications. Forms 3 and 4 only provide consent to collect and disseminate references to the U.S. person but neither Form 3 nor Form 4 provides consent to collect communications to or from the U.S. person who has executed the form. Each form contained in this Annex may be reproduced, provided the security classifications (top and bottom) are removed. It is the responsibility of the user to properly reclassify the consent form that is suitable to the user's purposes in accordance with requisite security guidelines and operational considerations of the customer whom the USSS is supporting.

H1.3. (U) Section 4.1.c. of United States Signals Intelligence Directive SP0018 states that the Director of NSA (DIRNSA) has authority to approve the consensual collection of communications to, from, or about U.S. persons. Elements of the USSS proposing to conduct consensual collection should forward a copy of the executed consent form and any pertinent information to the DIRNSA (or to the Senior Operations Officer of the National Security Operations Center) for approval of the proposed consensual collection activity. NSA OGC must also be notified promptly of the proposed collection activity.

H1.4. (U) If operational circumstances dictate, consent may be obtained orally or may be recorded on a form other than one of the forms contained in this Annex. However, any other form or method that is used to obtain and record a U.S. person's consent for elements of the USSS to collect and disseminate communications of or concerning that person must be reviewed and approved by NSA OGC.
