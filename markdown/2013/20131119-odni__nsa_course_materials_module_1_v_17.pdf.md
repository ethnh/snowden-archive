| \{TS/\SI/NF\} (QGC Attorney): During the first part of our road trip we will discuss the Business Records (BR) and Pen Register Trap and Trace (PR/TT) Bulk Metadata Programs at a high level. As we progress on our road trip, we will discuss various aspects of the authorities granted by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) which support the BR and PR/TT programs and the policies that N\&A implements to provide reasonable assurance that we are compliant with these authorities. |  |  |  |  |

(TS//SI//NF) (GGC Attorney): The BR and PR/TT programs are supported by two special authorities granted by the FISC which permit NSA to obtain telephony and internet communications bulk metadata from U.\$. based telecommunications service providers. The authority was granted by the FISC in support of the Counterterrorism mission to permit NSA to learn more about a terrorist target's communications, even those terrorists potentially located in the United States.
(TS//SI//NF) Bulk metadata consists of "unselected" communications events, and the BR and PR/TT Bulk Metadata Programs complement NSA's traditional selection-based intelligence collection.
(TS//SI//NF) As you can probably imagine, bulk internet and telephony metadata, acquired within the United States, contains information to, from, or about U.\$. persons. Therefore, because there is unminimized U.\$. person information included within this type of metadata, there are special rules and procedures we must follow when acquiring, processing, accessing, storing, sharing, and disseminating this information. This metadata is highly sensitive which is why we have this specialized training.
(TS//SI//NF) In this course we discuss the metadata we collect, how we collect it, what we are permitted to do with it as well as other special rules and procedures we must follow.

| (TS/JSI/NF) (QGC Attorney): To get started, let's discuss the individual Bulk Metadata Programs. The BR Program pertains to the acquisition of telephony metadata. The associated FISC Order allows NSA to ask specific U.S.-based telecommunications service providers for their business records. The business records, also known as call detail records, contain information about phone calls. |  |  |  |  |  |
| (TS/JSI/NF) The PR/TT program and associated FISC Order permits the collection of bulk Internet communications metadata. |  |  |  |  |  |
| (TS/JSI/NF) Under both these FISC orders, NSA is prohibited from acquiring communications content. Under these Programs, NSA may not listen to phone calls, or collect the body or subject of an email $\qquad$ The Bulk Metadata authorities permit the about the communications. |  |  |  |  |  |

(TS/JSI/NF) In Module 2, we will explore how each type of metadata is obtained and what specific information each order permits NSA to collect.

| GRAPHIC/AV: <br> (TS//SI//NF) Possible cutaway images may include: <br> - images pertinent to querying data <br> - image of query results being shared, disseminated, and retained |  |  |  |  |  |

(TS//SI//NF) (QGC Attorney): Due to the sensitivity of the data and the desire to protect the privacy of U.S. persons, the FI\&C imposes restrictions on how we can touch the data. For the purposes of this course, by "touch" we mean any activity where there is an opportunity to commit a violation with regards to the Orders governing these authorities. We recognize that it takes a very diverse team of individuals working to see that the data is properly acquired, routed, prepared, stored, then queried, shared and disseminated. From acquisition to dissemination, including management and compliance, if you play a role in enabling this data to be used for its intelligence value, we consider you to be someone who "touches" this data.
(TS//SI//NF) N\&A's goal is to provide reasonable assurance that we are complying with the law AND making the most of these authorities to support the counterterrorism mission and protect the United States.

(TS//SI//NF) (OGC Attorney): BR and PR/TT are two separate orders issued by the FISC, though the general access, sharing, dissemination, and retention rules are the same for the two programs. Those similarities are why the training for both is covered in this course. Additionally, both Orders target the same groups, referred to in the Orders as the Foreign Powers. The Foreign Powers named in the orders are (T) Both the BR and PR/TT prog
Articulable Suspicion, or RAS, to gain approval to query the bulk metadata with an identifier. We will get into much more detail about these two topics in later modules.

| GRAPHIC/AV: <br> (U) Possible cutaway images may include: <br> - images that depict the differences highlighted in the script |  |  |  |  |  |

(TS/JSI/NF) (OGC Attorney): There are two high level differences between the Orders as well. Details of the differences will be addressed in later modules, but at a basic level, the biggest difference between the two Programs is how the metadata is obtained. (TS/JSI/NF) The other point where the Bulk Metadata Programs differ is in the area of hop restrictions for contact chaining. This will be described in detail in Module 4, but for now it is important to know that according to the Orders the hop restrictions are different for the BR and PR/TT Programs.

(TS/JSI/INF) (OGC Attorney): NSA must reapply to the FISC every 90 days to continue operating under these authorities. This process allows for the Government to seek modifications and for the FISC to update these authorities to reflect changes that may affect NSA's collection and handling of BR and PR/TT bulk metadata. It is also crucial that all factors associated with NSA's implementation of these programs are fully compliant with the FISC Orders and guidelines.
(TS/JSI/INF) As new orders are issued, this training may be augmented to address significant changes. Your organization will notify you if or when additional training is necessary. Should you have questions, you are strongly encouraged to contact your manager, Counterterrorism (CT) Homeland Security Analysis Center (HSAC), Technology Directorate (TD) Compliance, SID Oversight and Compliance, or the Office of General Counsel (OGC) for assistance and guidance.

| GRAPHIC/AV: |  |  |  |  |  |

(TS//SI/INF) (OGC Attorney): Now that you have a better understanding of what the BR and PR/TT Bulk Metadata Programs are, you may be wondering where these programs fit in the context of the broader set of SIGINT authorities.
(TS//SI/INF) Recall from OVSC1100, the Overview of Signals Intelligence Authorities, that we learned that in addition to E.O. 12333, NSA may perform SIGINT functions under various FISA authorities to include NSA FISA, FBI FISA, FISA Amendments Act (FAA) Section 702, 704, and 705(b). While there are specific rules governing when and how these authorities may be applied, each of these authorities has the potential to provide a valuable and unique complement to our E.O. 12333 collection resources. Similarly, the BR and PR/TT Bulk Metadata Programs provide analysts with another opportunity to gain unique collection on a target. By leveraging as many of these various collection authorities available to them as permitted, analysts can fill existing knowledge gaps on their target.
(TS//SI/INF) One prime example of how an analyst leveraged several of these collection authorities to close crucial knowledge gaps on a target occurred in Fall 2009, when a CT analyst pieced together information obtained from E.O. 12333, FAA 702, and BR FISA authorities to reveal a terrorist plot on the New York subway system, which was subsequently disrupted by the FBI.

| GRAPHIC/AV: |  |  |  |  |  |

(TS//SI//NF) (QGC Attorney): It is also important to understand what the BR and PR/TT Bulk Metadata programs are not. You may have heard of SPCMA the Supplemental Procedures Governing Communications Metadata Analysis. They allow NSA to treat communications metadata differently than content in the course of the analysis of communications metadata already lawfully collected under E.O. 12333, NSA FISA, FBI FISA, FAA 702, 704, and 705\{b\} authorities. Specifically, given a valid and documented foreign intelligence purpose, these new procedures permit contact chaining Communications metadata identifier, irrespective of nationality or location, in order to follow or discover valid foreign intelligence targets. What SPCMA and the BR and PR/TT programs have in common, then, is that they both exclusively involve metadata, and allow for queries of identifiers belonging to U.S. persons.
(TS//SI//NF) Unlike SPCMA, however, the BR and PR/TT Programs authorize the acquisition of unselected, bulk metadata. Because of the sensitivity of this metadata, it may only be queried with identifiers for which RAS exists to believe that the identifier is directly associated with the Foreign Powers specified in the Court Order granted by the FISC. You will learn much more about the RAS standard in Module 3.
