## MEMORANDUM FOR THE DEPUTY PROGRAM MANAGER FOR COUNTERTERRORISM SPECIAL PROJECTS, ANALYSIS AND PRODUCTION

SUBJECT: (TS//SI//NF) Assessments of Reasonable Articulable Suspicion Pursuant to Orders of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court - INFORMATION MEMORANDUM

1. (TS//SI//NF) This memorandum reissues OGC guidance to aid in the determinations SID personnel are called upon to make with respect to telephony and electronic metadata under the control orders addressed to the resolution of the report.

Specifically, the memo elaborates on the legal standard applicable to the contact-chaining activities in which SID offices engage pursuant to Business Records Order 08-08 (as well as subsequent Orders for the production of telephony records) ${ }^{1}$ as well as to the contact chaining activities in which SID analysts engage pursuant to the Pen Register and Trap and Trace Order 08-110 (as well as subsequent Pen/Trap Orders). ${ }^{2,3}$

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ (TS//SI//NF) The Business Records Order is captioned "In re Application of the Federal Bureau of Investigation for an Order Requiring the Production of Temptile Things froml"

    2 (TS//SI//NF) The Pen/Trap Order is captioned $\square$

    3 (TS//SI//NF) OGC memorandum dated October 13, 2006, same subject, is canceled. This memorandum updates the prior memorandum to reflect changes in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) authorizations, specifically, authorizing a year to develop a contract under the Orders for analysis related to the FISC.

    The substantive guidance concerning the application of the "reasonable articulable suspicion" standard with respect to the authorizations remains unchanged.
2. (IS/ST/NF) Both of the Orders set out a standard that allows access to the data when NSA has identified a known telephone number or other electronic identifier for which, based on the factual and practical considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent persons act, there are facts giving rise to a reasonable articulable suspicion that the telephone number or electronic identifier ${ }^{4}$ is associated with
3. ${ }^{5}$ provided, however, that a telephone number or an account or address
increased by 5 used by a U.S. person shall not be regarded as associated with
solely on the basis of activities that are protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution. When such a determination has been made, NSA is authorized by the Orders to use such numbers/electronic identifiers as "seed" addresses by querying the accumulated data to determine other telephone numbers or electronic identifiers the seed has contacted.

# A. Summary of the Standard 

3. (TS//SI/NF) The "reasonable articulable suspicion" standard embodied in the Court's Orders requires that before an analyst may use a telephone number or electronic identifier as a "seed" address to query the database of records, he/she must be able to articulate some fact or set of facts that causes him/her to suspect that the number is associated with

This formulation means that analysts are not free to use a telephone number or electronic identifier based merely on a hunch or guess, but must instead base their decisions on specific facts that would cause a reasonable person to form such a suspicion.
4. (TS//SI/NF) Note that the standard does not present a particularly high hurdle. ${ }^{6}$ The level of evidence demanded by the standard is considerably less than proof by a preponderance of the evidence, meaning that here one need not show it is more likely than not that a number is associated with

[^0]The specific list is included in the FISC orders.
${ }^{6}(\mathrm{U} /$ FOUO) The reasonable articulable suspicion standard comes from the law enforcement context and therefore the cases addressing it focus on actions of police officers. See Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968). The idea underpinning the standard is that the police may stop and briefly detain someone for investigative purposes if the officer involved has a reasonable suspicion supported by articulable facts that criminal activity "may be afcot," even where the officer lacks probable cause to believe that this is so. See U.S. v. Sokolow, 490 U.S. 1, 7 (1989). The officer must be able to articulate something more than an "inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or 'hunch.' " Terry at 27. Rather, the standard demands some "minimal level of objective justification" for making the stop in question. INS v. Delgado, 466 U.S. 210, 217 (1984).


[^0]:    ${ }^{4}$ (TS//SI/NF) The term electronic identifier is intended to include not only email addresses, but also similar routing and addressing information that effects delivery of electronic communications.
    ${ }^{5}$ (TS//SI/NF) The phrase "associated terrorist organization" connotes a particular list of perncietionings
    "estimate" by the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to have allied themselves with
Sokolow at 7. Indeed, the Courts have made clear that the level of suspicion required for a Terry stop - i.e. the level of suspicion required to constitute a reasonable articulable suspicion -- is "obviously less demanding than that for probable cause." Id. (citations omitted.) ${ }^{7}$ Further, the Sokolow Court observed that the concept of reasonable suspicion, like probable cause, requires an examination of the totality of the circumstances - the whole picture. Id., citing U.S. v. Cortez, 449 U.S. 411, 417 (1981). The Sokolow Court, quoting one of its earlier cases, noted that "[t]he process does not deal with hard certainties, but with probabilities. Long before the law of probabilities was articulated as such, practical people formulated certain common-sense conclusions about human behavior; jurors as factfinders are permitted to do the same - and so are law enforcement officers." See Cortez at 418.
5. (TS//SI//NF) In addition, for reasons set out below we understand that "associated" to mean engaged in a common enterprise with one of the groups designated by the DNI to have allied itself with or with someone acting as an agent thereof. Finally, in a case in which an analyst intends to base his suspicion of a number/electronic identifier used by Party A solely on, contact with Party B, such contact must be direct contact, and it must be more likely true than not true that Party B is a member or agent of

# B. Association with 

6. (TS//SI//NF) As we alluded to above, the meaning of the word "associated" is important to the analysis, since the determination that must be made is that a telephone number or electronic identifier is associated with
consult the groups designated by the DNI to have allied itself

While this standard does not say explicitly that the telephone number or electronic identifier at issue must be used by a member or agent of
and while we do not insist on such a finding here, we note that the dictionary definition of "associate" suggests a knowing relationship and engagement in a common enterprise. ${ }^{9}$ Therefore, in making their assessments, analysts should consider whether, given the totality of the circumstances, there exist articulable suspicion think that a telephone number or electronic identifier bears a relationship to
or one of the groups designated by the DNI to have allied itself

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{7}$ (U) Reasonable articulable suspicion is a low standard of proof. The common standards of proof and common applications of the standards are set out in Enclosure 1.
    ${ }^{8}$ (TS//SI//NF). For example, if Party B is a known

    9 would meet the standard for chaining. Thus, Party B's association with requires a
    probable cause or higher showing.
    ${ }^{9}$ (U//FOGG). For example, "associate" is defined as follows: "to join as a partner, friend or companion; to keep company with;" and also: "to combine or join with other parts." Merriam Webster Collegiate Dictionary, Tenth Edition, at 70.
of a nature that suggests it is used by someone engaged in a common enterprise with one of the aforementioned.
7. (TS/\SI/NF) We recognize too that there may be cases in which an analyst's reasona'le articulable suspicion that a number is associated wit
will be based on telephone or e-mail contacts alone. While basing a determination on more information than this is preferable (and indeed is required to the degree more information is available, since one is required to examine the totality of the circumstances), analysts must when premising their determinations solely on contact be mindful of what they actually know about the parties involved. For example, an analyst who has reasonable articulable suspicion with respect to a particular telephone number could not query the database to determine what number is three "hops" away in the communications chain, and then, based on such contact alone, conclude that the number three hops away now should be used as a seed number. Therefore, in cases in which communications contacts are the sole justification for concluding that a number is associated with
such contact must (1) be direct contact, and
(2) must he with a number or electronic identifier for which we have concluded it is more likely than not used by a member of

# C. First Amendment Considerations 

8. (TS/\SI/NF) In addition, the Orders each contain a provision stating that a telephone number or electronic identifier believed to be used by a U.S. person shall not be recorded as associated with

## C. First Amendment Considerations

8. (TS/\SI/NF) In order to establish a meaningful association from contact alone between the two numbers, A and B, where B is a number that is already in contact, is must be more likely true than not true that number B is used by e.g., a member or agent of
Neither vague statements about the role of Party B in
nor an indirect linking of the number in question with Party B (e.g., Party A was in contact with Party X, who was in contact with Party B, who is probably a member of the will suffice on their own to satisfy the standard as to Party A. Where the reasonable articulable suspicion comes from contact alone, such contact must be direct with a member or agent of the same or another member of the same or another, and it must be more likely than not that our designation of such member or agent is in fact accurate. This advice should help serve to prevent the potential for endless "bootstrapping." As we have discussed, the danger in carrying out the instructions in the Court's Order is a suspicion that ceases to be reasonable because of the seriousness of the connection. We believe that this analytic framework will go a long way to countering any such tendency that might exist. See enclosure 2 .
Congressman to cut off funding for U.S. troops in Iraq - that his number or electronic identifier is therefore associated with

But, as we have already made clear, we do not read the Order to preclude under all circumstances the conclusion that a number is associated with

# 10.1.1.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2
13. (C) The fact that these Orders only concern communications routing information, or metadata, rather than the substance of communications, further underscores the limited relevance of the First Amendment in the context of association. The D.C. Circuit observed in 1978 that data-gathering activities using legitimate investigative techniques do not violate the First Amendment, at least where no Fourth Amendment privacy is infringed. See Reporters' Committee for Freedom of the Press v. AT\&T, 593 F.2d 1030, 1064 (D.C. Cir. 1978). Since individuals do not enjoy a reasonable expectation of privacy under the Fourth Amendment in the communications metadata NSA acquires under these Orders, Smith v. Maryland, 442 U.S. 735 (1979), the investigative techniques NSA uses pursuant to the Orders do not run afoul of the First Amendment. As the Court in the Reporters' Committee case observed, the First Amendment offers no procedural or substantive protection from good faith criminal investigation beyond that afforded by the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. Reporters' Committee at 1057 .
14. (TS/ST/NF) The above makes clear that the Courts have fashioned protections for association in order to preserve the other rights guaranteed by the Constitution in the First Amendment. Since the right to free association has been found by Courts to be protected largely as an extension of the other constitutional protections in order to keep these rights from being frustrated, and because the derivative right to associate is subsumed by the more specific rights enumerated in the Amendment, we conclude that the terms of the Court's Orders are not intended in the context of these Orders to preclude entirely the conclusion of association based on communications contact observed in communications metadata. We therefore advise that NSA is obligated by the terms of these Orders to refrain from finding an association with
based solely on these activities that are explicitly attored protection by the language of First Amendment. But NSA is not precluded from finding an association based on direct contact with a member of
so long as such contact is direct and the evidence shows it more likely than not that the putative member of an aforementioned group is in fact a member.

# D. Summary 

15. (TS/SI/NF) Analysts making a determination as to whether a telephone number or electronic identifier is eligible to be a "seed" must consider all the facts that they know or reasonably can know prior to engaging in contact chaining. Looking at the totality of the circumstances, the whole picture, they must determine whether a reasonable articulação suspicion exists that the telenhone number or electronic identifier is associated with
is there reason to suspect that the person using the telenhone number is in league with
The evidence required is considerably less than a showing that it is more likely than not that a number is associated with one of the aforementioned. Rather, there must be an articulable reason, constituting
more than a bunch, for suspecting that a number is associated with all

In cases where a number or identifier is suspicious based solely on its contact with another number or identifier, it must be more likely than not that the other number is used by a member or agent of the same name, and the other number is not known by the same name and the contact between the two numbers must be direct contact.

# Enclosure 1 

The following chart sets out common standards of proof, the level of proof required in legal actions to discharge the burden of proof, as well as common applications of the standard. The standards are listed from the highest standard to the lowest.

| Standard of Proof | Application |
| :-- | :-- |
| Beyond a Reasonable Doubt | Required for criminal conviction. ${ }^{1}$ |
| Clear and Convincing Evidence | Required to prevail in some civil actions. ${ }^{2}$ |
| Preponderance of Evidence | Required to prevail in most civil cases. The <br> standard is met if the proposition is more <br> likely to be true than not true. |
| Probable Cause | Required for search and arrest warrants. ${ }^{3}$ |
| Reasonable Articulable Suspicion | Required for "Terry" (investigative) stop; see <br> pp. 2-3 of memorandum. |

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ This standard historically has been reserved for criminal cases. The Supreme Court has held that "the Due Process Clause protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged." In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 364 (1970).
    ${ }^{2}$ A landmark Supreme Court case reviewing the standard of proof required for involuntary commitment of an individual held that an individual's "interest in the outcome of a civil commitment proceeding is of such weight and gravity that due process requires the state to justify confinement by proof more substantial than a mere preponderance of the evidence." The Court held that the "clear and convincing" standard was required to meet due process guarantees.. Addington v. Texas, 441 U.S. 418, 427 (1979).
    ${ }^{3}$ The Supreme Court has held probable cause to mean "a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found." Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 238 (1983).
