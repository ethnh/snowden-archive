## Yahoo Webmessenger

- Update data sent to individuals logged into Yahoo's Instant Messenger service online
- Online contact status, unread emails in Yahoo inbox
- Usually small sessions (2-4kB)
- Sporadic collection (30,000 - 60,000 sessions per day)
- Intermittent bursts of collection against contacts of targets
- Large numbers of sessions (20,000+) against a single targeted selector
- Not collected against the target (online presence/unread email from target)
- No owner attribution (metadata value limited to fact-of comms for emails, online presence events for buddies)
- Over a dozen selectors detasked in two weeks
- Because a target's contact was using/idling on Yahoo Webmessenger
- Several very timely selectors (Libyan transition, Greek financial related)
# Address Books 

- Email address books for most major webmail are collected as stand-alone sessions (no content present*)
- Address books are repetitive, large, and metadata-rich
- Data is stored multiple times (MARINA/MAINWAY, PINWALE, CLOUDs)
- Fewer and fewer address books attributable to users, targets
- Address books account for 22\% of SSO's major accesses (up from 12\% in August)

| Access (10 Jan 12) | Total Sessions | Address Books |
| :-- | --: | --: |
| US-3171 | 1488453 | 237067 (16\% of traffic) |

## Buddy Lists,Inboxes

- Unlike address books, frequently contain content data
- Offline messages, buddy icon updates, other data included
- Webmail inboxes increasingly include email content
- Most collection is due to the presence of a target on a buddy list where the communication is not to, from, or about that target
- NSA collects, on a representative day, 500,000 buddylists and inboxes
- More than $90 \%$ collected because tasked selectors identified only as contacts (not communicant, content, or owner)
- Identifying buddylists and inboxes without content (or without useful content) an ongoing challenge

## Scenario: <br> (○) <br> (O)yahoo

- Sep 2011
(Oyahoo.com (tasked S2E, asw Iran Quds Force) has his/her Yahoo account hacked by an unknown actor, sends out spam email to his/her contact list:

# TOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN 

## Scenario: <br> (○)yahoo

- 

0yahoo.com has a number of Yahoo groups in his/her contact list, some with many hundreds or thousands of members

- At DS-200B in particular, collection spiked as:
- The initial spam messages were sent (and collected)
- Inboxes of email recipients were viewed by $\square$ contact list
- Messages were sometimes viewed, but more often sent as precached views on Google and Yahoo (along with inboxes)
- Inboxes where the recipient did not delete the spam message continued to be collected every time they were viewed
- Some recipients added $\square$ (○)yahoo.com to their address books (possibly as a spam defeat?) - address books were collected every time

## Scenario: <br> (○)yahoo

- 

○yahoo.com emergency detasked from DS-200B and US-3171 at 13:04Z on 20 Oct

- Numerous first-order address books and inboxes collected meant tasked selectors on address books or buddy lists of contacts of (○)yahoo.com also affected:
- 

○yahoo.com and @gmail.com emergency detasked off US-3171 at 13:10Z on 20 Sep

- Memorializing to PINWALE only address books and inboxes owned by target selectors would have reduced PINWALE volumes $90 \%+$
- Site XKEYSCOREs would buffer data for SIGDEV purposes
- Metadata from known owner address books and inboxes stored regardless

## Mobile IMAP

- IMAP protocol used by email clients to fetch mail from server(s)
- Not designed for devices with intermittent connections (i.e. mobile phones)
- Android implementation in particular uses a lot of bandwidth
