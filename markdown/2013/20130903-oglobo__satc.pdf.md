# (U) The benefits 

a (S//REL) Allows the analyst to implement analytics that
$\square$ Are customized to their needs on a target-by-target basis
aCould not or should not be run against all collection aMight find a needle in a haystack in an repeatable and efficient way
# (U) Contact Graphs 

a(U) A graph is a set of objects (nodes, vertices) connected by links (edges).
a(U) Graphs are a useful way of visualizing and analyzing the structure of communication networks

# (U) Hops 

a(U) We may build a 1-hop graph by selecting all vertices connected to a root node
a(U) A 1.5-hop graph contains all vertices connected to a root node and all connections between those vertices

# (U//FOUO) S2C41 surge effort 

(TS//SI//REL) NSA's Mexico Leadership Team (S2C41) conducted a twoweek target development surge effort against one of Mexico's leading presidential candidates, Enrique Pena Nieto, and nine of his close associates. Nieto is considered by most political pundits to be the likely winner of the 2012 Mexican presidential elections which are to be held in July 2012. SATC leveraged graph analysis in the development surge's target development effort.

Discovered new selectors associated with high-value targets
# (U) Conclusion 

a(S//REL) Contact graph-enhanced filtering is a simple yet effective technique, which may allow you to find previously unobtainable results and empower analytic discovery a(TS//SI//REL) Teaming with S2C, SATC was able to successfully apply this technique against highprofile, OPSEC-savvy Brazilian and Mexican targets.
