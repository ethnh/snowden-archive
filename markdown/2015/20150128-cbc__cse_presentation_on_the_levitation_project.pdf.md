# FFU Hypothesis 

## Extremists use Free File Upload (FFU) sites differently than the general public.

Al-Qaida uses FFU sites to distribute Jihadist propaganda

Extremists use FFU sites to distribute training materials

# What do we need? 

A list of suspect documents
A list of FFU URLs referring to those documents
A list of IPs downloading those URLs

New documents are found by CWOC (CSEC Web Operations Centre) retrieval from URLs, so that's the easy part.
# New URLs 

CSEC's web forums team
$2^{\text {nd }}$ Party reports \& alerts

## HTTP Referrers

# FFU Events Collection 

ATOMIC BANJO (Special Source) is collecting HTTP metadata for 102 known FFU sites.
![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)

We see about 10-15 million FFU events per day
All the FFU Events are available thru OLYMPIA
# Looking for a few good documents 

We only care about the 2,200 URLs that point to documents of interest.
e.g. How to make a gas bomb www.sendspace.com/file/ $\square$

Every day we sort through the 1015 M events for the interesting ones.
We're finding about 350 interesting download events per month.

FFU hit from selector 7/03/2012 7:46:51 geolocated to Kenya, accessing The Explosives Course through FFU site sendspace.com with HTTP user agent Mozilla/5.0 (Ubuntu; X11; Linux x86_64; rv:9.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/ 9.0.1

Can we correlate any other selectors with this IP address?

# Successes 

An HTTP-referred URL gave us a German hostage video from a previously unknown target.
