# WHY ARE WE TEACHING THIS? 

- 5 Pillars of IO:
- OPSEC
- MILDEC
- MISO
- EW
- CNO
- The next major conflict will start in cyberspace
- Whether we recognize the signs is another matter
- Recent conflicts have already shown the importance of CNO (Russia/Georgia)
- Think China will make a move on Taiwan without bringing down their communications networks?
- As IW officers (or IDC) - we are expected to know and understand CNO and communicate with decision makers
- Recently announced plans from Command in Chief and Pentagon officials emphasize cyber space operations
- Basic 1810/IDC quals are a good foundation, but CO/XO want you to know more about CNO
