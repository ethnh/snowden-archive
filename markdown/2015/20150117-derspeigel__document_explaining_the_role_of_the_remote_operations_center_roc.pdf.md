FROM: the Remote Operations Center (S321)

Run Date: 09/06/2006
(TS//SI) What if your job was to exploit a target's computer, collect voice cuts from an adversaries phone system, use a terrorist's web-based email account to infect them with a Trojan Horse, and assist the military in locating a high value terrorist
targets for capture -- all in a day's work? Then you would be working in the Remote Operations Center (ROC)!
(TS//SI) ROC personnel:

- Remotely penetrate hard targets and classified foreign networks and extract sensitive SIGINT data.
- Remotely exploit and collect SIGINT data of both foreign country and terrorist computer and telephony networks.
- Geolocate high-value Counterterrorism targets around the world.
- Provide real-time support in the apprehension or rendition of high-profile terrorists.
- Manage, operate, and maintain the covert infrastructure used to conduct network operations.
(TS//SI) The ROC provides a crucial piece of the puzzle in helping the Agency achieve the Transformation 3.0 objective of Global Network Dominance. ROC exploitation and collection requirements have grown at an unbelievable rate. The recent opening of a new ROC workspace (see a related article appearing on NSA Daily today) was essential in allowing an increase in operations, strengthening of the 24/7 operations pace, and expanding operational partnerships with NSA/CSS Texas, NSA/CSS Hawaii, and NSA/CSS Georgia.
(TS//SI) The ROC has already enjoyed great success in its CNE, CNA and CND (Computer Network Exploitation/Attack/Defense) operations, and is bound to achieve even more in its new facilities. Their motto says it all: "Your data is our data, your equipment is our equipment - anytime, any place, by any legal means."
