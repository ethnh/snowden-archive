FRIEN (C/FOUS) Research Still Nation (F77)

Ran Dine 9/300/2010
(FN/SE/REL) Hackers are reading the emails of some of our targets... by collecting the hackers' "tides," we 11 get access to the emails themselves and 21 get insights into which being hacked.

(FN/SE/REL) People who open attachments from unknown smokers (gasp) or respond to "Vegetarian" money (sandering emails over) the only individuals on the internet being hacked. Some of our targets are also being targeted by outside forces, both by state-sponsored and freelance hackers. Could your target's communications be the target of other countries or groups?
(FN/SE/REL) Recently, Communications Security Fund/Johnson Canada (CSF) (and Monovile Hill Station (MHS) discovered and began explaining a major rich state set being under by hackers. The hackers' sophisticated email reading intrusion acts to have as (FOUS.ER.ANT. Of the traffic observed, nearly half contains category lists because the windows are targeting small accounts of interest in the Intelligence Community. Although a relatively new state source, (CSF) have already written multiple reports based on (FOUS.ER.ANT. editor).

# (C) Technique 

(FN/SE/REL) To the analysis using FRIEN’ databases, collected (FOUS.ER.ANT. data levels like People that Trained/Processed (PMTF) and/ To this way, though, the traffic data has been hard at work... To find the traffic, the hackers program quits a variety of and into pieces. Each piece is then obliterated, given a different, specifal, source. If address and unit is a different destination (P address, forcing different destination (P additional access to main the pieces across separate channels) ${ }^{1}$ of a satellite signal. The channels being used carry large amounts of traffic, allowing (FOUS.ER.ANT. data to link as background noise. Much collaboration between CSF, MHS, GCPQ and VGCP) has brought about the manifestations of (FOUS.ER.ANT. data we collect into "standards" PMTF must.

## (C/FOUS) Vintage Set

(FN/SE/REL) (FOUS.ER.ANT. traffic is very organized. Each event is labeled to identify and categorize victims. If your attacks commonly apply, descriptors to each victim - A helpx hard victims and track which attacks succeed and which fail. Victim categories make (FOUS.ER.ANT. interesting)

## A - Induce Expression, & Induce Vices

## B - Conduct Some Relevance

C - Conduct Remote Quality Evaluation
D - Conduct the Divergence of Boundaries
E - E.gene Activity
F - F.gene and based due to a Subsistence and Indian phone promotion
G - Gbaine Governance & Code

(FN/SE/REL) New victims appear to flood out their entire tribes, going back months or, even, years. Their only new mail is transmitted. Standards of emails are seen on an average day.

## (C) Distribution

(FN/SE/REL) Within the world of crime applications, distribution is always difficult and (FOUS.ER.ANT.) an exception. Initial analysis points toward a likely state-sponsored based on the level of sophistication and the victim set. Determining which state is sponsoring the activity has yet to be done. Since the traffic is traveling over satellite, the expert must be within the satellite based. Insights to receive the media emails. Their way kept the Insights would point to which state was responsible, but this hope was not realized as shown in this image.

## (FN/SE/REL) distribution of (FOUS.ER.ANT. data is difficult, since this satellite beanspropriate as large. Eventually, the virtual team working this effort would like to know who it kaceling whom.

## (C) Way Forward

(FN/SE/REL) Analysis continues with the goal of learning more about the attacks as well as improving attributes. Efforts are also being made to inform relevant parties, including VITAL, due to the obvious operations security (OPSEL) concerns where CS and CSL authorities have contact with Indian diplomats or the European Special Representative, for instance.

(FN/SE/REL) In this next time you now your target's email, pay special attention to the case scenarios. It is common APSTAL ${ }^{2}$ (PRESIDENTIAL) and Providers in the case of (FOUS.ER.ANT.) from the email is likely available because somebody else has hacked your target. For additional details, send an email to substanders/jouns.c.gov.

## (C) Nouns

1. (C/FOUS) Pudden Identifiers, PIDs are used in satellite web signals to designate sub-channels.
2. (FN/SE/REL) APSTAL stands for "Stealth party (self)" or "non-sourcing FRIEN’." These terms are used within the FRIEN’ community to refer to the practice of collecting data as it means the Internet going from the victim's computer to the attacker's.
